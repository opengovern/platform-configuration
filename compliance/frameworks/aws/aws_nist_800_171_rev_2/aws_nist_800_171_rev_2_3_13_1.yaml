Title: "13.1 Monitor, control, and protect communications (i.e., information transmitted
  or received by organizational systems) at the external boundaries and key internal
  boundaries of organizational systems"
Description: "Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary
  components and by restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems.
  Boundary components include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based
  malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented
  within a system security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application
  gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Restricting or prohibiting interfaces
  in organizational systems includes restricting external web communications traffic
  to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic
  that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared
  nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security
  requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications
  services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems
  shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third party-provided
  access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent
  sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions."
