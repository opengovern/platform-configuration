Title: "2.5 Remove all unnecessary functionality, such as scripts, drivers, features,
  subsystems, file systems, and unnecessary web servers"
Description: "Unnecessary functions can provide additional opportunities for malicious
  individuals to gain access to a system. By removing unnecessary functionality, organizations
  can focus on securing the functions that are required and reduce the risk that unknown
  functions will be exploited. Including this in server-hardening standards and processes
  addresses the specific security implications associated with unnecessary functions
  (for example, by removing/disabling FTP or the web server if the server will not
  be performing those functions)."
