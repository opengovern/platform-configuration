Title: "3.5 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that the firewall
  permits only established connections into the internal network and denies any inbound
  connections not associated with a previously established session"
Description: "A firewall that maintains the `state` (or the status) for each connection
  through the firewall knows whether an apparent response to a previous connection
  is actually a valid, authorized response (since it retains each connection's
  status) or is malicious traffic trying to trick the firewall into allowing the connection."
