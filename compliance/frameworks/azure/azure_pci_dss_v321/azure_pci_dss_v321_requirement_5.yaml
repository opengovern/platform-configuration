  title: Requirement 5 - Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs
  description: Malicious software (a.k.a “malware”) exploits system vulnerabilities after entering the network via users' e-mail and other online business activities. Anti-virus software must be used on all systems commonly affected by malware to protect systems from current and evolving malicious software threats. Additional anti-malware solutions may supplement (but not replace) anti-virus software.
