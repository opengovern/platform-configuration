  title: Examine firewall and router configurations and perform the following to verify that connections are restricted between untrusted networks and system components in the cardholder data environment
  description: It is essential to install network protection between the internal, trusted network and any untrusted network that is external and/or out of the entity's ability to control or manage. Failure to implement this measure correctly results in the entity being vulnerable to unauthorized access by malicious individuals or software. For firewall functionality to be effective, it must be properly configured to control and/or limit traffic into and out of the entity's network.
