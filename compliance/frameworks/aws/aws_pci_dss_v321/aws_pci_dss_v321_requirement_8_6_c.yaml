Title: "6.c Examine system configuration settings and/or physical controls, as applicable,
  to verify that controls are implemented to ensure only the intended account can
  use that mechanism to gain access"
Description: "If user authentication mechanisms such as tokens, smart cards, and
  certificates can be used by multiple accounts, it may be impossible to identify
  the individual using the authentication mechanism. Having physical and/or logical
  controls (for example, a PIN, biometric data, or a password) to uniquely identify
  the user of the account will prevent unauthorized users from gaining access through
  use of a shared authentication mechanism."
