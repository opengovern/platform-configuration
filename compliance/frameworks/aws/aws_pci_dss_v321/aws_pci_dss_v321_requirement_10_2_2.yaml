Title: "2.2 All actions taken by any individual with root or administrative privileges"
Description: "Accounts with increased privileges, such as the “administrator” or
  “root” account, have the potential to greatly impact the security or operational
  functionality of a system. Without a log of the activities performed, an organization
  is unable to trace any issues resulting from an administrative mistake or misuse
  of privilege back to the specific action and individual. This control verifies all
  actions taken by any individual with root or administrative privileges are logged."
