Title: "Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery"
Description: "The organization identifies the critical business processes requiring
  business continuity. Information security aspects of business continuity are (i)
  based on identifying events (or sequence of events) that can cause interruptions
  to the organization's critical business processes (e.g., equipment failure,
  human errors, theft, fire, natural disasters acts of terrorism); (ii) followed by
  a risk assessment to determine the probability and impact of such interruptions,
  in terms of time, damage scale and recovery period; (iii) based on the results of
  the risk assessment, a business continuity strategy is developed to identify the
  overall approach to business continuity; and (iv) once this strategy has been created,
  endorsement is provided by management, and a plan created and endorsed to implement
  this strategy."
