Title: "Develop configuration standards for all system components"
Description: "Assure that these standards address all known security vulnerabilities
  and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards. Sources of
  industry-accepted system hardening standards may include, but are not limited to
  Center for Internet Security (CIS), International Organization for Standardization
  (ISO), SysAdmin Audit Network Security (SANS) Institute and National Institute of
  Standards Technology (NIST). There are known weaknesses with many operating systems,
  databases, and enterprise applications, and there are also known ways to configure
  these systems to fix security vulnerabilities. To help those that are not security
  experts, a number of security organizations have established system-hardening guidelines
  and recommendations, which advise how to correct these weaknesses. Examples of sources
  for guidance on configuration standards include, but are not limited to: www.nist.gov,
  www.sans.org, and www.cisecurity.org, www.iso.org, and product vendors. System configuration
  standards must be kept up to date to ensure that newly identified weaknesses are
  corrected prior to a system being installed on the network."
