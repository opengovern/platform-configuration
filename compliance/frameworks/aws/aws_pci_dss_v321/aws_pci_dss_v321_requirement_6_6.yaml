Title: "For public-facing web applications, ensure that either one of the requirements
  are in place"
Description: "Verify following methods is in place as follows: examine documented
  processes, interview personnel, and examine records of application security assessments
  to verify that public-facing web applications are reviewed—using either manual or
  automated vulnerability security assessment tools or methods—as follows: - At least
  annually - After any changes - By an organization that specializes in application
  security - That, at a minimum, all vulnerabilities in Requirement 6.5 are included
  in the assessment - That all vulnerabilities are corrected - That the application
  is re-evaluated after the corrections. Examine the system configuration settings
  and interview responsible personnel to verify that an automated technical solution
  that detects and prevents web-based attacks (for example, a web-application firewall)
  is in place as follows: - Is situated in front of public-facing web applications
  to detect and prevent web-based attacks. - Is actively running and up to date as
  applicable. - Is generating audit logs. - Is configured to either block web-based
  attacks, or generate an alert that is immediately investigated.Public-facing web
  applications are primary targets for attackers, and poorly coded web applications
  provide an easy path for attackers to gain access to sensitive data and systems.
  The requirement for reviewing applications or installing web-application firewalls
  is intended to reduce the number of compromises on public-facing web applications
  due to poor coding or application management practices. Manual or automated vulnerability
  security assessment tools or methods review and/or test the application for vulnerabilities,
  web-application firewalls filter and block non- essential traffic at the application
  layer. Used in conjunction with a network-based firewall, a properly configured
  web-application firewall prevents application-layer attacks if applications are
  improperly coded or configured. This can be achieved through a combination of technology
  and process. Process-based solutions must have mechanisms that facilitate timely
  responses to alerts in order to meet the intent of this requirement, which is to
  prevent attacks. Note: “An organization that specializes in application security”
  can be either a third-party company or an internal organization, as long as the
  reviewers specialize in application security and can demonstrate independence from
  the development team. For public-facing web applications, address new threats and
  vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis and ensure these applications are protected
  against known attacks by either of the following methods: reviewing public-facing
  web applications via manual or automated application vulnerability security assessment
  tools or methods, at least annually and after any changes Note: This assessment
  is not the same as the vulnerability scans performed for Requirement 11.2., Installing
  an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web- based attacks (for
  example, a web- application firewall) in front of public- facing web applications,
  to continually check all traffic."
