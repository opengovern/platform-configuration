Title: "2.4.b Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only:
  Review internal processes and customer/user documentation to verify that non-consumer
  customer user passwords/passphrases are required to change periodically; and non-consumer
  customer users are given guidance as to when, and under what circumstances, passwords/passphrases
  must change"
Description: "Passwords/passphrases that are valid for a long time without a change
  provide malicious individuals with more time to work on breaking the password/phrase.
  Note: Testing Procedure 8.2.4.b is an additional procedure that only applies if
  the entity being assessed is a service provider."
