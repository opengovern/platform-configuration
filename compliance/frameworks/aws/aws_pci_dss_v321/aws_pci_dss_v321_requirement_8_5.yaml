Title: "Do not use group, shared, or generic IDs, passwords, or other authentication
  methods"
Description: "Generic user IDs are disabled or removed. Shared user IDs do not exist
  for system administration and other critical functions. Shared and generic user
  IDs are not used to administer any system components. If multiple users share the
  same authentication credentials (for example, user account and password), it becomes
  impossible to trace system access and activities to an individual. This in turn
  prevents an entity from assigning accountability for, or having effective logging
  of, an individual's actions, since a given action could have been performed
  by anyone in the group that has knowledge of the authentication credentials."
