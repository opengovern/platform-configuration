Title: "Requirement 6 - Develop and maintain secure systems and applications"
Description: "Security vulnerabilities in systems and applications may allow criminals
  to access PAN and other cardholder data. Many of these vulnerabilities are eliminated
  by installing vendor-provided security patches, which perform a quick-repair job
  for a specific piece of programming code. All critical systems must have the most
  recently released software patches to prevent exploitation. Entities should apply
  patches to less-critical systems as soon as possible, based on a risk-based vulnerability
  management program."
