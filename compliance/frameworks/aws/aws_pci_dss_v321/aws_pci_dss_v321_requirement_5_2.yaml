  title: Ensure that all anti-virus mechanisms are maintained
  description: "Anti-virus mechanisms should be maintained as follows: are kept current, perform periodic scans and generate audit logs which are retained per PCI DSS Requirement 10.7. Even the best anti-virus solutions are limited in effectiveness if they are not maintained and kept current with the latest security updates, signature files, or malware protections. Audit logs provide the ability to monitor virus and malware activity and anti-malware reactions. Thus, it is imperative that anti-malware solutions be configured to generate audit logs and that these logs be managed in accordance with Requirement 10."
