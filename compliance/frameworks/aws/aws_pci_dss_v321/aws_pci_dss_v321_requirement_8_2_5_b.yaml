Title: "2.5.b Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only
  to review internal processes and customer/user documentation to verify that new
  non-consumer customer user passwords/passphrase cannot be the same as the previous
  four passwords"
Description: "If password history isn't maintained, the effectiveness of changing
  passwords is reduced, as previous passwords can be reused over and over. Requiring
  that passwords cannot be reused for a period of time reduces the likelihood that
  passwords that have been guessed or brute-forced will be used in the future. Note:
  Testing Procedure 8.2.5.b is an additional procedure that only applies if the entity
  being assessed is a service provider."
