Title: "14.1e Verify the integrity of [Assignment: organization-defined security
  critical or essential software] using root of trust mechanisms or cryptographic
  signatures"
Description: "Verifying the integrity of the organizationâ€™s security-critical or
  essential software is an important capability since corrupted software is the primary
  attack vector used by adversaries to undermine or disrupt the proper functioning
  of organizational systems. There are many ways to verify software integrity throughout
  the system development life cycle. Root of trust mechanisms (e.g., secure boot,
  trusted platform modules, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface [UEFI]), verify
  that only trusted code is executed during boot processes. This capability helps
  system components protect the integrity of boot firmware in organizational systems
  by verifying the integrity and authenticity of updates to the firmware prior to
  applying changes to the system component and preventing unauthorized processes from
  modifying the boot firmware. The employment of cryptographic signatures ensures
  the integrity and authenticity of critical and essential software that stores, processes,
  or transmits, CUI. Cryptographic signatures include digital signatures and the computation
  and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality
  of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash
  information. Hardware roots of trust are considered to be more secure."
