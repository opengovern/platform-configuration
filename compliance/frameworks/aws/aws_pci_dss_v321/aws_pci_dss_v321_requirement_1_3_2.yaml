Title: "3.2 Limit inbound Internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ"
Description: "The DMZ is that part of the network that manages connections between
  the Internet (or other untrusted networks), and services that an organization needs
  to have available to the public (like a web server). This functionality is intended
  to prevent malicious individuals from accessing the organization's internal
  network from the Internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized
  manner. The set of controls will limit inbound Internet traffic to IP addresses
  within the DMZ."
