Title: "2.7 Creation and deletion of system- level objects"
Description: "Malicious software, such as malware, often creates or replaces system
  level objects on the target system in order to control a particular function or
  operation on that system. By logging when system-level objects, such as database
  tables or stored procedures, are created or deleted, it will be easier to determine
  whether such modifications were authorized. This control verifies creation and deletion
  of system level objects are logged."
