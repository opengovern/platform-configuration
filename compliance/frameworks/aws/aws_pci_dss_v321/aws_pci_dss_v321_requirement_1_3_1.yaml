Title: "3.1 Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only system components that
  provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports"
Description: "The DMZ is that part of the network that manages connections between
  the Internet (or other untrusted networks), and services that an organization needs
  to have available to the public (like a web server). This functionality is intended
  to prevent malicious individuals from accessing the organization's internal
  network from the Internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized
  manner. The set of controls will examine firewall and router configurations to verify
  that a DMZ is implemented to limit inbound traffic to only system components that
  provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports."
