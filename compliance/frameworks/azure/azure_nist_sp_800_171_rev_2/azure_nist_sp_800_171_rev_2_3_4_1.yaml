Title: "4.1 Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational
  systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the
  respective system development life cycles"
Description: "Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon
  specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline
  configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and changes to systems.
  Baseline configurations include information about system components (e.g., standard
  software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network
  components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and update and patch information
  on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings and parameters),
  network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system
  architecture. Baseline configurations of systems also reflect the current enterprise
  architecture. Maintaining effective baseline configurations requires creating new
  baselines as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configuration maintenance
  includes reviewing and updating the baseline configuration when changes are made
  based on security risks and deviations from the established baseline configuration
  Organizations can implement centralized system component inventories that include
  components from multiple organizational systems. In such situations, organizations
  ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific information required
  for proper component accountability (e.g., system association, system owner). Information
  deemed necessary for effective accountability of system components includes hardware
  inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers,
  component owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and network
  addresses. Inventory specifications include manufacturer, device type, model, serial
  number, and physical location."
