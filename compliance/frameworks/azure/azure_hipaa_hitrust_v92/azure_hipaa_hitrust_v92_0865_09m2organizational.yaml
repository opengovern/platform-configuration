  security agreements or other formal agreement; (ii) documents each connection, the
  interface characteristics, security requirements, and the nature of the information
  communicated; (iii) employs a deny all, permit by exception policy for allowing
  connections from the information system to other information systems outside of

  etc.), except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed."
