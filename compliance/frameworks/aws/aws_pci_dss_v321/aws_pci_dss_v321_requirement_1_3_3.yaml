Title: "3.3 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that anti-spoofing
  measures are implemented, for example internal addresses cannot pass from the Internet
  into the DMZ"
Description: "Normally a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally
  sent it so other computers in the network know where the packet came from. Malicious
  individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending IP address so that
  the target system believes the packet is from a trusted source. Filtering packets
  coming into the network helps to, among other things, ensure packets are not “spoofed”
  to look like they are coming from an organization's own internal network."
