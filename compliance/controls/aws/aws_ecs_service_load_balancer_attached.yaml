Title: "ECS services should be attached to a load balancer"
Description: "ECS service can be configured to use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic evenly across the tasks in your service. It is recommended to use Application Load Balancers for your AWS ECS services so that you can take advantage of these latest features, unless your service requires a feature that is only available with Network Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers."
