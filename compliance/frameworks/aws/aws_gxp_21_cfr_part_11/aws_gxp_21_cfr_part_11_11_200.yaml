  title: Electronic signature components and controls
  description: Electronic signatures that are not biometric (i.e., not based on a physical feature, like a fingerprint) must be made up of at least two distinct parts  (i.e.,user ID and password). Biometric electronic signature (e.g., fingerprint scan, retinal scan) can only be used by the individuals to whom they are assigned.
