Title: "1.e Examine system configurations to verify that the protocol is implemented
  to use only secure configurations and does not support insecure versions or configurations"
Description: "Sensitive information must be encrypted during transmission over public
  networks, because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept
  and/or divert data while in transit. Secure transmission of cardholder data requires
  using trusted keys/certificates, a secure protocol for transport, and proper encryption
  strength to encrypt cardholder data. Connection requests from systems that do not
  support the required encryption strength, and that would result in an insecure connection,
  should not be accepted. Note that some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH
  v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain
  control of the affected system. Whichever security protocol is used, ensure it is
  configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure
  connection—for example, by using only trusted certificates and supporting only strong
  encryption (not supporting weaker, insecure protocols or methods). Verifying that
  certificates are trusted (for example, have not expired and are issued from a trusted
  source) helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. Generally, the web
  page URL should begin with `HTTPS` and/or the web browser display a padlock icon
  somewhere in the window of the browser. Many TLS certificate vendors also provide
  a highly visible verification seal— sometimes referred to as a “security seal,”
  `secure site seal,` or “secure trust seal”)—which may provide the ability to click
  on the seal to reveal information about the website. Refer to industry standards
  and best practices for information on strong cryptography and secure protocols (e.g.,
  NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57, OWASP, etc.) Note: SSL/early TLS is not considered
  strong cryptography and may not be used as a security control, except by POS POI
  terminals that are verified as not being susceptible to known exploits and the termination
  points to which they connect as defined in Appendix A2."
