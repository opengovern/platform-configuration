Title: "Vulnerability Management"
Description: "A vulnerability can be defined as an inherent configuration flaw in
  an organization's information technology base, whether hardware or software,
  which can be exploited by a third party to gather sensitive information regarding
  the organization. Vulnerability management is an ongoing process to determine the
  process of eliminating or mitigating vulnerabilities based upon the risk and cost
  associated with the vulnerabilities. NBFCs may devise a strategy for managing and
  eliminating vulnerabilities and such strategy may clearly be communicated in the
  Cyber Security policy."
