Title: "Keep cardholder data storage to a minimum by implementing data retention
  and disposal policies, procedures and processes"
Description: "Procedures and processes should include at least the following for
  all cardholder data (CHD) storage: limiting data storage amount and retention time
  to that which is required for legal, regulatory, and/or business requirements, specific
  retention requirements for cardholder data, processes for secure deletion of data
  when no longer needed, a quarterly process for identifying and securely deleting
  stored cardholder data that exceeds defined retention. Identifying and deleting
  stored data that has exceeded its specified retention period prevents unnecessary
  retention of data that is no longer needed. This process may be automated or manual
  or a combination of both. For example, a programmatic procedure (automatic or manual)
  to locate and remove data and/or a manual review of data storage areas could be
  performed. Implementing secure deletion methods ensure that the data cannot be retrieved
  when it is no longer needed. Remember, if you don't need it, don't
  store it!"
