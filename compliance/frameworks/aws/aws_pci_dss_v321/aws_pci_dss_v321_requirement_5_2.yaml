Title: "Ensure that all anti-virus mechanisms are maintained"
Description: "Anti-virus mechanisms should be maintained as follows: are kept current,
  perform periodic scans and generate audit logs which are retained per PCI DSS Requirement
  10.7. Even the best anti-virus solutions are limited in effectiveness if they are
  not maintained and kept current with the latest security updates, signature files,
  or malware protections. Audit logs provide the ability to monitor virus and malware
  activity and anti-malware reactions. Thus, it is imperative that anti-malware solutions
  be configured to generate audit logs and that these logs be managed in accordance
  with Requirement 10."
