Title: "3.1 Create and retain system audit logs and records to the extent needed
  to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or
  unauthorized system activity"
Description: "An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful
  or unauthorized system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a
  logging functionality is needed as those events which are significant and relevant
  to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to
  meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password changes,
  failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative privilege usage,
  or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging,
  organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the CUI
  security requirements. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with
  other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have
  the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not
  activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential
  burden on system performance. Audit records can be generated at various levels of
  abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network.
  Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit
  logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems.
  Organizations consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to
  cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes
  (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions
  that occur in service-oriented or cloudbased architectures. Audit record content
  that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps, source and
  destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, success
  or fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules
  invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific
  results (e.g., the security state of the system after the event occurred). Detailed
  information that organizations may consider in audit records includes full text
  recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.
  Organizations consider limiting the additional audit log information to only that
  information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates
  the use of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially
  be misleading or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest.
  Audit logs are reviewed and analyzed as often as needed to provide important information
  to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision making."
