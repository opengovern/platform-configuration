Title: "2.d Verify that system configuration standards include the procedures like
  changing of all vendor-supplied defaults and elimination of unnecessary default
  accounts etc. for all types of system components"
Description: "System configuration standards include the following procedures for
  all types of system components: changing of all vendor-supplied defaults and elimination
  of unnecessary default accounts, implementing only one primary function per server
  to prevent functions that require different security levels from co-existing on
  the same server, enabling only necessary services, protocols, daemons, etc., as
  required for the function of the system, implementing additional security features
  for any required services, protocols or daemons that are considered to be insecure,
  configuring system security parameters to prevent misuse and removing all unnecessary
  functionality, such as scripts, drivers, features, subsystems, file systems, and
  unnecessary web servers. There are known weaknesses with many operating systems,
  databases, and enterprise applications, and there are also known ways to configure
  these systems to fix security vulnerabilities. To help those that are not security
  experts, a number of security organizations have established system-hardening guidelines
  and recommendations, which advise how to correct these weaknesses. Examples of sources
  for guidance on configuration standards include, but are not limited to: www.nist.gov,
  www.sans.org, and www.cisecurity.org, www.iso.org, and product vendors. System configuration
  standards must be kept up to date to ensure that newly identified weaknesses are
  corrected prior to a system being installed on the network."
