Title: "14.1 Identify, report, and correct system flaws in a timely manner"
Description: "Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software
  and firmware flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws
  and report this information to designated personnel with information security responsibilities.
  Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus
  signatures. Organizations address flaws discovered during security assessments,
  continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling.
  Organizations can take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness
  Enumeration (CWE) database or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database
  in remediating flaws discovered in organizational systems. Organization-defined
  time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based
  on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity
  of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation
  may require more testing than other types of remediation."
