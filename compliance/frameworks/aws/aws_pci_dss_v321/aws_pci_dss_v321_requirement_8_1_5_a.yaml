Title: "1.5.a Interview personnel and observe processes for managing accounts used
  by third parties to access, support, or maintain system components to verify that
  accounts used for remote access are disabled when not in use, enabled only when
  needed by the third party and disabled when not in use"
Description: "Allowing vendors to have 24/7 access into your network in case they
  need to support your systems increases the chances of unauthorized access, either
  from a user in the vendor's environment or from a malicious individual who
  finds and uses this always-available external entry point into your network. Enabling
  access only for the time periods needed, and disabling it as soon as it is no longer
  needed, helps prevent misuse of these connections. Monitoring of vendor access provides
  assurance that vendors are accessing only the systems necessary and only during
  approved time frames."
