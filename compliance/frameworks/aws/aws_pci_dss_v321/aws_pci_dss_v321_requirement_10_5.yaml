Title: "Interview system administrators and examine system configurations and permissions
  to verify that audit trails are secured so that they cannot be altered"
Description: "Often a malicious individual who has entered the network will attempt
  to edit the audit logs in order to hide their activity. Without adequate protection
  of audit logs, their completeness, accuracy, and integrity cannot be guaranteed,
  and the audit logs can be rendered useless as an investigation tool after a compromise.
  This control checks secure audit trails so they cannot be altered."
