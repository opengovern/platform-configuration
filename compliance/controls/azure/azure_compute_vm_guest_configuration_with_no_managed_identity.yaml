Title: "Add system-assigned managed identity to enable Guest Configuration assignments on virtual machines with no identities"
Description: "This policy adds a system-assigned managed identity to virtual machines hosted in Azure that are supported by Guest Configuration but do not have any managed identities. A system-assigned managed identity is a prerequisite for all Guest Configuration assignments and must be added to machines before using any Guest Configuration policy definitions."
