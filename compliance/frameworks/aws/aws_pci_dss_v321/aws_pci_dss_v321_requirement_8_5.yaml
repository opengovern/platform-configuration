  title: Do not use group, shared, or generic IDs, passwords, or other authentication methods
  description: Generic user IDs are disabled or removed. Shared user IDs do not exist for system administration and other critical functions. Shared and generic user IDs are not used to administer any system components. If multiple users share the same authentication credentials (for example, user account and password), it becomes impossible to trace system access and activities to an individual. This in turn prevents an entity from assigning accountability for, or having effective logging of, an individual's actions, since a given action could have been performed by anyone in the group that has knowledge of the authentication credentials.
