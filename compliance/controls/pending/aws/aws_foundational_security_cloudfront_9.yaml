Title: "9 CloudFront distributions should encrypt traffic to custom origins"
Description: "This control checks if Amazon CloudFront distributions are encrypting traffic to custom origins. This control fails for a CloudFront distribution whose origin protocol policy allows 'http-only'. This control also fails if the distribution's origin protocol policy is 'match-viewer' while the viewer protocol policy is 'allow-all'."
