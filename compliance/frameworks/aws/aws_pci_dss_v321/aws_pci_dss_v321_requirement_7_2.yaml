  title: Examine system settings and vendor documentation to verify that an access control system(s)
  description: "Without a mechanism to restrict access based on user's need to know, a user may unknowingly be granted access to cardholder data. Access control systems automate the process of restricting access and assigning privileges. Additionally, a default “deny-all” setting ensures no one is granted access until and unless a rule is established specifically granting such access. Entities may have one or more access controls systems to manage user access. Note: Some access control systems are set by default to “allow-all,” thereby permitting access unless/until a rule is written to specifically deny it."
