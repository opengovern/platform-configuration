Title: "4.1.c Examine the configurations and observe the processes to verify that
  cardholder data on removable media is encrypted wherever stored"
Description: "Note: If disk encryption is not used to encrypt removable media, the
  data stored on this media will need to be rendered unreadable through some other
  method. The intent of this requirement is to address the acceptability of disk-level
  encryption for rendering cardholder data unreadable. Disk-level encryption encrypts
  the entire disk/partition on a computer and automatically decrypts the information
  when an authorized user requests it. Many disk- encryption solutions intercept operating
  system read/write operations and carry out the appropriate cryptographic transformations
  without any special action by the user other than supplying a password or pass phrase
  upon system startup or at the beginning of a session. Based on these characteristics
  of disk-level encryption, to be compliant with this requirement, the method cannot:
  1) Use the same user account authenticator as the operating system, or 2) Use a
  decryption key that is associated with or derived from the system's local
  user account database or general network login credentials. Full disk encryption
  helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore may
  be appropriate for portable devices that store cardholder data."
