  title: 6.4 Cryptographic key changes for keys that have reached the end of their cryptoperiod (for example, after a defined period of time has passed and/or after a certain amount of cipher-text has been produced by a given key), as defined by the associated application vendor or key owner, and based on industry best practices and guidelines
  description: A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a particular cryptographic key can be used for its defined purpose. Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the sensitivity of the data being encrypted. Periodic changing of encryption keys when the keys have reached the end of their cryptoperiod is imperative to minimize the risk of someone's obtaining the encryption keys, and using them to decrypt data.
