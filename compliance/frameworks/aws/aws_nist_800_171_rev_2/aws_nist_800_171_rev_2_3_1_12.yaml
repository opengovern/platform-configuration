Title: "1.12 Monitor and control remote access sessions"
Description: "Remote access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes
  acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet).
  Remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often
  employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality over
  remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote;
  however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate control (e.g.,
  employing encryption techniques for confidentiality protection), may provide sufficient
  assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as
  internal networks. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the capability to adequately
  monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Automated monitoring
  and control of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyberattacks
  and help to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection
  activities of remote users on a variety of system components (e.g., servers, workstations,
  notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets)."
