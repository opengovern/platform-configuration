Title: "4.c Examine IDS/IPS configurations and vendor documentation to verify intrusion-detection
  and/or intrusion- prevention techniques are configured, maintained, and updated
  per vendor instructions to ensure optimal protection"
Description: "Intrusion detection and/or intrusion prevention techniques (such as
  IDS/IPS) compare the traffic coming into the network with known “signatures” and/or
  behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware),
  and send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it happens. Without a proactive approach
  to unauthorized activity detection, attacks on (or misuse of) computer resources
  could go unnoticed in real time. Security alerts generated by these techniques should
  be monitored so that the attempted intrusions can be stopped."
