Title: "1.4 Observe user accounts to verify that any inactive accounts over 90 days
  old are either removed or disabled"
Description: "Accounts that are not used regularly are often targets of attack since
  it is less likely that any changes (such as a changed password) will be noticed.
  As such, these accounts may be more easily exploited and used to access cardholder
  data."
