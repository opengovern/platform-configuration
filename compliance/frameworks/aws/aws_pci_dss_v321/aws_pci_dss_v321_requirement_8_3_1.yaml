Title: "3.1 Incorporate multi-factor authentication for all non-console access into
  the CDE for personnel with administrative access"
Description: "This requirement is intended to apply to all personnel with administrative
  access to the CDE. This requirement applies only to personnel with administrative
  access and only for non-console access to the CDE; it does not apply to application
  or system accounts performing automated functions. If the entity does not use segmentation
  to separate the CDE from the rest of their network, an administrator could use multi-factor
  authentication either when logging onto the CDE network or when logging onto a system.
  If the CDE is segmented from the rest of the entityâ€™s network, an administrator
  would need to use multi- factor authentication when connecting to a CDE system from
  a non-CDE network. Multi-factor authentication can be implemented at network level
  or at system/application level; it does not have to be both. If the administrator
  uses MFA when logging into the CDE network, they do not also need to use MFA to
  log into a particular system or application within the CDE."
