Title: "7.b Examine database and application configuration settings to verify that
  all user access to, user queries of, and user actions on (for example, move, copy,
  delete), the database are through programmatic methods only (for example, through
  stored procedures)"
Description: "Without user authentication for access to databases and applications,
  the potential for unauthorized or malicious access increases, and such access cannot
  be logged since the user has not been authenticated and is therefore not known to
  the system. Also, database access should be granted through programmatic methods
  only (for example, through stored procedures), rather than via direct access to
  the database by end users (except for DBAs, who may need direct access to the database
  for their administrative duties)."
