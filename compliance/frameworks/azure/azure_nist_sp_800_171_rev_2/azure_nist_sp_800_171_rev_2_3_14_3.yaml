Title: "14.3 Monitor system security alerts and advisories and take action in response"
Description: "There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts
  and advisories. For example, the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s Cybersecurity
  and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) generates security alerts and advisories
  to maintain situational awareness across the federal government and in nonfederal
  organizations. Software vendors, subscription services, and industry information
  sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) may also provide security alerts and advisories.
  Examples of response actions include notifying relevant external organizations,
  for example, external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external
  service providers, and peer or supporting organizations."
