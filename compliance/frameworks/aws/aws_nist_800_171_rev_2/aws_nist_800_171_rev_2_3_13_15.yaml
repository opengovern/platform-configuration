title: 13.15 Protect the authenticity of communications sessions
description: Authenticity protection includes protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into communications sessions. This requirement addresses communications protection at the session versus packet level (e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services) and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted.
