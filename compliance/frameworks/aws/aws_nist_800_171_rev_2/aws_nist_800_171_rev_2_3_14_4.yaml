Title: "14.4 Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available"
Description: "Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions
  and reputationbased technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to
  limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management
  and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution
  of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious
  code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs,
  back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business
  functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect
  such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including
  secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement
  processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform
  functions other than the functions intended."
