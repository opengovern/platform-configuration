Title: "13.2 Employ architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems
  engineering principles that promote effective information security within organizational
  systems"
Description: "Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new
  development systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations
  apply systems security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications
  to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware
  components within those systems. The application of systems security engineering
  concepts and principles helps to develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems
  and system components and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to disruptions,
  hazards, and threats. Examples of these concepts and principles include developing
  layered protections; establishing security policies, architecture, and controls
  as the foundation for design; incorporating security requirements into the system
  development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring
  that developers are trained on how to build secure software; and performing threat
  modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design
  patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that
  apply security engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development
  of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk
  to acceptable levels; and make informed risk-management decisions."
