Title: "Organizational Requirements"
Description: "The Security Rule includes the Standard, Business associate contracts
  or other arrangements. A covered entity is not in compliance with the standard if
  the it knows of a pattern of an activity or practice of the business associate that
  constitutes a material breach or violation of the business associate's obligation
  to safeguard ePHI (under the contract or other arrangement), unless the covered
  entity takes reasonable steps to cure the breach or end the violation, as applicable.
  If such steps are unsuccessful, the covered entity is required to terminate the
  contract or arrangement, if feasible or if termination is not feasible, report the
  problem to the Secretary (HHS)."
