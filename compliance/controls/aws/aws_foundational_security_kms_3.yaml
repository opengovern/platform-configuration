Title: "3 AWS KMS keys should not be unintentionally deleted"
Description: "This control checks whether AWS KMS customer managed keys (CMK) are scheduled for deletion. The control fails if a CMK is scheduled for deletion. CMKs cannot be recovered once deleted. Data encrypted under a KMS CMK is also permanently unrecoverable if the CMK is deleted. If meaningful data has been encrypted under a CMK scheduled for deletion,consider decrypting the data or re-encrypting the data under a new CMK unless you are intentionally performing a cryptographic erasure."
