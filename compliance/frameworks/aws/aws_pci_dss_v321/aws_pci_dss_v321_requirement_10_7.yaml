Title: "Retain audit trail history for at least one year, with a minimum of three
  months immediately available for analysis (for example, online, archived, or restorable
  from backup)"
Description: "Retaining logs for at least a year allows for the fact that it often
  takes a while to notice that a compromise has occurred or is occurring, and allows
  investigators sufficient log history to better determine the length of time of a
  potential breach and potential system(s) impacted. By having three months of logs
  immediately available, an entity can quickly identify and minimize impact of a data
  breach. Storing logs in off-line locations could prevent them from being readily
  available, resulting in longer time frames to restore log data, perform analysis,
  and identify impacted systems or data."
