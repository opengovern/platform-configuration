Title: "3.5 Correlate audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes for
  investigation and response to indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious,
  or unusual activity"
Description: "Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes
  helps to ensure that they do not operate independently, but rather collectively.
  Regarding the assessment of a given organizational system, the requirement is agnostic
  as to whether this correlation is applied at the system level or at the organization
  level across all systems."
