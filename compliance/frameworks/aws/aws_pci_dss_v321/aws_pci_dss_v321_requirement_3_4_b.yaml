Title: "4.b Examine several tables or files from a sample of data repositories to
  verify the PAN is rendered unreadable (that is, not stored in plain-text)"
Description: "PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text
  files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception
  or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on
  strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions
  are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes
  are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional,
  random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the
  feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from)
  tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently
  remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the
  first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic
  token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A
  one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only
  once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and
  key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary
  of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested
  and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong
  cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN,
  a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value. Controls that prevent
  the correlation of this data will help ensure that the original PAN remains unreadable."
