Title: "14.5 Perform periodic scans of the information system and real-time scans
  of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed"
Description: "Periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files
  from external sources can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be encoded in
  various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden
  files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code
  can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic
  mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code
  insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities."
