Title: "1.3 Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations"
Description: "Information flow control regulates where information can travel within
  a system and between systems (versus who can access the information) and without
  explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions
  include the following: keeping exportcontrolled information from being transmitted
  in the clear to the Internet; blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within
  the organization; restricting requests to the Internet that are not from the internal
  web proxy server; and limiting information transfers between organizations based
  on data structures and content. Organizations commonly use information flow control
  policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated
  sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems
  and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of
  the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection
  devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ
  rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide
  a packetfiltering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability
  based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document
  characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and
  inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are
  critical to information flow enforcement. Transferring information between systems
  representing different security domains with different security policies introduces
  risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations,
  information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement
  points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
  architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement
  includes: prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e.,
  allowing access only); employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information
  flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes
  and security labels."
