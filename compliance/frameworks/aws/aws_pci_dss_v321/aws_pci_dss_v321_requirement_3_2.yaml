Title: "Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization (even if encrypted)"
Description: "If sensitive authentication data is received, render all data unrecoverable
  upon completion of the authorization process. It is permissible for issuers and
  companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if
  there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication
  data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3.
  Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code
  or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization
  is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows
  them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities
  that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often
  create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function.
  It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services
  to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need
  to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers,
  and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication
  data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason
  is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for
  the issuer and not one of convenience. Any such data must be stored securely and
  in accordance with all PCI DSS and specific payment brand requirements."
