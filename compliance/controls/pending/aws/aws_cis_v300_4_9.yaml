Title: "4.9 Ensure AWS Config configuration changes are monitored"
Description: "Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs, or an external Security information and event management (SIEM) environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to AWS Config's configurations."
