Title: "14.6 Monitor organizational systems, including inbound and outbound communications
  traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks"
Description: "System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External
  monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e.,
  part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes
  the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations can monitor
  systems, for example, by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing
  other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other
  actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. System
  monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g.,
  intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection
  software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software).
  Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations
  and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices being
  employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring information
  collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of
  systems to support such objectives. System monitoring is an integral part of continuous
  monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves
  as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection
  is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local
  area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating
  through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections
  can be either wired or wireless. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions
  related to inbound/outbound communications traffic include internal traffic that
  indicates the presence of malicious code in systems or propagating among system
  components, the unauthorized exporting of information, or signaling to external
  systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify potentially compromised
  systems or system components. System monitoring requirements, including the need
  for specific types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements."
