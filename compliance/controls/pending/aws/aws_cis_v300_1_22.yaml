Title: "1.22 Ensure access to AWSCloudShellFullAccess is restricted"
Description: "AWS CloudShell is a convenient way of running CLI commands against AWS services; a managed IAM policy ('AWSCloudShellFullAccess') provides full access to CloudShell, which allows file upload and download capability between a user's local system and the CloudShell environment. Within the CloudShell environment a user has sudo permissions, and can access the internet. So it is feasible to install file transfer software (for example) and move data from CloudShell to external internet servers."
