Title: "Azure API for FHIR should use a customer-managed key to encrypt data at rest"
Description: "Use a customer-managed key to control the encryption at rest of the data stored in Azure API for FHIR when this is a regulatory or compliance requirement. Customer-managed keys also deliver double encryption by adding a second layer of encryption on top of the default one done with service-managed keys."
