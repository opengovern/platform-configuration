Title: "Examine firewall and router configurations and perform the following to verify
  that connections are restricted between untrusted networks and system components
  in the cardholder data environment"
Description: "It is essential to install network protection between the internal,
  trusted network and any untrusted network that is external and/or out of the entity's
  ability to control or manage. Failure to implement this measure correctly results
  in the entity being vulnerable to unauthorized access by malicious individuals or
  software. For firewall functionality to be effective, it must be properly configured
  to control and/or limit traffic into and out of the entity's network."
