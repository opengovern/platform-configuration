Title: "Deploy a change-detection mechanism (for example, file-integrity monitoring
  tools) to alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including changes, additions,
  and deletions) of critical system files, configuration files, or content files;
  and configure the software to perform critical file comparisons at least weekly"
Description: "Change-detection solutions such as file-integrity monitoring (FIM)
  tools check for changes, additions, and deletions to critical files, and notify
  when such changes are detected. If not implemented properly and the output of the
  change-detection solution monitored, a malicious individual could add, remove, or
  alter configuration file contents, operating system programs, or application executables.
  Unauthorized changes, if undetected, could render existing security controls ineffective
  and/or result in cardholder data being stolen with no perceptible impact to normal
  processing."
