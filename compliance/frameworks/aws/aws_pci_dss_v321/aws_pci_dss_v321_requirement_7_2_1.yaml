Title: "2.1 Confirm that access control systems are in place on all system components"
Description: "Without a mechanism to restrict access based on user's need
  to know, a user may unknowingly be granted access to cardholder data. Access control
  systems automate the process of restricting access and assigning privileges. Additionally,
  a default “deny-all” setting ensures no one is granted access until and unless a
  rule is established specifically granting such access. Entities may have one or
  more access controls systems to manage user access. Note: Some access control systems
  are set by default to “allow-all,” thereby permitting access unless/until a rule
  is written to specifically deny it."
