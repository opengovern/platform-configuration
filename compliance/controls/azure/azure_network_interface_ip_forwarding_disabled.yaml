ID: azure_network_interface_ip_forwarding_disabled
Title: "IP Forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled"
Description: "Enabling IP forwarding on a virtual machine's NIC allows the machine to receive traffic addressed to other destinations. IP forwarding is rarely required (e.g., when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team."
