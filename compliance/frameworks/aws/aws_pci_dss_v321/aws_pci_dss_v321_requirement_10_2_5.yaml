  but not limited to creation of new accounts and elevation of privileges—and all
  changes, additions, or deletions to accounts with root or administrative privileges"
Description: "Without knowing who was logged on at the time of an incident, it is
  impossible to identify the accounts that may have been used. Additionally, malicious
  users may attempt to manipulate the authentication controls with the intent of bypassing
  them or impersonating a valid account."
