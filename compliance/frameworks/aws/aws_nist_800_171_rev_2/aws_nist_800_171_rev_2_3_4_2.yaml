Title: "4.2 Establish and enforce security configuration settings for information
  technology products employed in organizational systems"
Description: "Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed
  in hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security
  posture or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which
  security-related configuration settings can be defined include mainframe computers,
  servers, workstations, input and output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers),
  network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches,
  wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware,
  and applications. Security parameters are those parameters impacting the security
  state of systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements.
  Security parameters include: registry settings; account, file, directory permission
  settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, and remote connections.
  Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently
  derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become
  part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred
  to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security
  reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized,
  standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings
  for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring
  those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations
  can be developed by a variety of organizations including information technology
  product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal
  agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors."
