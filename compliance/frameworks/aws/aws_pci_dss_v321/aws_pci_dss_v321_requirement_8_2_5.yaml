Title: "2.5 Do not allow an individual to submit a new password/passphrase that is
  the same as any of the last four passwords/passphrases he or she has used"
Description: "If password history isn't maintained, the effectiveness of changing
  passwords is reduced, as previous passwords can be reused over and over. Requiring
  that passwords cannot be reused for a period of time reduces the likelihood that
  passwords that have been guessed or brute-forced will be used in the future. Note:
  Testing Procedure 8.2.5.b is an additional procedure that only applies if the entity
  being assessed is a service provider."
