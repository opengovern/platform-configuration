Title: "1.b Interview responsible personnel and observe processes to verify that
  new security vulnerabilities are identified, a risk ranking is assigned to vulnerabilities
  that includes identification of all “high risk” and “critical” vulnerabilities and
  processes to identify new security vulnerabilities include using reputable outside
  sources for security vulnerability information"
Description: "The intent of this requirement is that organizations keep up to date
  with new vulnerabilities that may impact their environment. Sources for vulnerability
  information should be trustworthy and often include vendor websites, industry news
  groups, mailing list, or RSS feeds. Once an organization identifies a vulnerability
  that could affect their environment, the risk that the vulnerability poses must
  be evaluated and ranked. The organization must therefore have a method in place
  to evaluate vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis and assign risk rankings to those
  vulnerabilities. This is not achieved by an ASV scan or internal vulnerability scan,
  rather this requires a process to actively monitor industry sources for vulnerability
  information. Classifying the risks (for example, as “high,” “medium,” or “low”)
  allows organizations to identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk items
  more quickly and reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilities posing the greatest
  risk will be exploited."
