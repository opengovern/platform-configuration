Title: "3.2 Incorporate multi-factor authentication for all remote network access
  (both user and administrator, and including third-party access for support or maintenance)
  originating from outside the entity's network"
Description: "This requirement is intended to apply to all personnel—including general
  users, administrators, and vendors (for support or maintenance) with remote access
  to the network—where that remote access could lead to access to the CDE. If remote
  access is to an entity's network that has appropriate segmentation, such
  that remote users cannot access or impact the cardholder data environment, multi-factor
  authentication for remote access to that network would not be required. However,
  multi- factor authentication is required for any remote access to networks with
  access to the cardholder data environment, and is recommended for all remote access
  to the entity's networks."
