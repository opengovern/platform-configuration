Title: "User Authentication for External Connections"
Description: "When accessing electronic protected health information (ePHI) from
  external sources, it's crucial to prioritize user authentication as part
  of our commitment to HIPAA and HITRUST compliance. To ensure secure access, we have
  implemented strong authentication measures, including unique user IDs, strong passwords,
  and multi-factor authentication. These measures verify the identity of individuals
  accessing ePHI remotely, ensuring that only authorized users with the right credentials
  can establish secure connections. By prioritizing user authentication, we protect
  the confidentiality of sensitive health information and minimize the risk of unauthorized
  access."
