Title: "1.5 Manage IDs used by third parties to access, support, or maintain system
  components via remote access by enabling only during the time period needed and
  disabled when not in use"
Description: "Allowing vendors to have 24/7 access into your network in case they
  need to support your systems increases the chances of unauthorized access, either
  from a user in the vendor's environment or from a malicious individual who
  finds and uses this always-available external entry point into your network. Enabling
  access only for the time periods needed, and disabling it as soon as it is no longer
  needed, helps prevent misuse of these connections. Monitoring of vendor access provides
  assurance that vendors are accessing only the systems necessary and only during
  approved time frames."
