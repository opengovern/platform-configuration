Title: "4.3e Employ automated discovery and management tools to maintain an up-to-date,
  complete, accurate, and readily available inventory of system components"
Description: "The system component inventory includes system-specific information
  required for component accountability and to provide support to identify, control,
  monitor, and verify configuration items in accordance with the authoritative source.
  The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes
  the system name, hardware and software component owners,hardware inventory specifications,software
  license information,software version numbers, and—for networked components—the machine
  names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include the manufacturer,
  supplier information, component type, date of receipt, cost, model, serial number,
  and physical location. Organizations also use automated mechanisms to implement
  and maintain authoritative (i.e., up-to-date, complete, accurate, and available)
  baseline configurations for systems that include hardware and software inventory
  tools, configuration management tools, and network management tools. Tools can be
  used to track version numbers on operating systems, applications, types of software
  installed, and current patch levels."
