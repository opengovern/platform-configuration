ID: aws_iam_access_analyzer_enabled_without_findings
Title: "IAM Access analyzer should be enabled without findings"
Description: "This control checks whether the IAM Access analyzer is enabled without findings. If you grant permissions to an S3 bucket in one of your organization member accounts to a principal in another organization member account, IAM Access Analyzer does not generate a finding. But if you grant permission to a principal in an account that is not a member of the organization, IAM Access Analyzer generates a finding."
