Title: "11.2 Scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications
  periodically and when new vulnerabilities affecting those systems and applications
  are identified"
Description: "Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all
  system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked
  printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned
  are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning
  methods developed. This process ensures that potential vulnerabilities in the system
  are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability analyses for
  custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis,
  dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations
  can employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of
  tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers)
  and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for patch
  levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be
  accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly
  operating information flow control mechanisms. To facilitate interoperability, organizations
  consider using products that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated,
  scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) naming convention, and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language
  (OVAL) to determine the presence of system vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability
  information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National
  Vulnerability Database (NVD). Security assessments, such as red team exercises,
  provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations
  also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common
  Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability
  scanning may be more intrusive or the system component that is the subject of the
  scanning may contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access authorization
  to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability scanning and protects
  the sensitive nature of such scanning."
