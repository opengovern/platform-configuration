Title: "3.6 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that system components
  that store cardholder data are on an internal network zone, segregated from the
  DMZ and other untrusted networks"
Description: "If cardholder data is located within the DMZ, it is easier for an external
  attacker to access this information, since there are fewer layers to penetrate.
  Securing system components that store cardholder data (such as a database) in an
  internal network zone that is segregated from the DMZ and other untrusted networks
  by a firewall can prevent unauthorized network traffic from reaching the system
  component."
