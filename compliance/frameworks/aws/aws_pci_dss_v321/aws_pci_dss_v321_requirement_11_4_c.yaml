  title: 4.c Examine IDS/IPS configurations and vendor documentation to verify intrusion-detection and/or intrusion- prevention techniques are configured, maintained, and updated per vendor instructions to ensure optimal protection
  description: Intrusion detection and/or intrusion prevention techniques (such as IDS/IPS) compare the traffic coming into the network with known “signatures” and/or behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware), and send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it happens. Without a proactive approach to unauthorized activity detection, attacks on (or misuse of) computer resources could go unnoticed in real time. Security alerts generated by these techniques should be monitored so that the attempted intrusions can be stopped.
