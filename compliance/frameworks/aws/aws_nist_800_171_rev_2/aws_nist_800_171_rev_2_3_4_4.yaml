Title: "4.4 Analyze the security impact of changes prior to implementation"
Description: "Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities
  (e.g., system administrators, system security officers, system security managers,
  and systems security engineers) conduct security impact analyses. Individuals conducting
  security impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical expertise to
  analyze the changes to systems and the associated security ramifications. Security
  impact analysis may include reviewing security plans to understand security requirements
  and reviewing system design documentation to understand the implementation of controls
  and how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may
  also include risk assessments to better understand the impact of the changes and
  to determine if additional controls are required."
