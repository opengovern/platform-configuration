Title: "3.3 Review and update logged events"
Description: "The intent of this requirement is to periodically re-evaluate which
  logged events will continue to be included in the list of events to be logged. The
  event types that are logged by organizations may change over time. Reviewing and
  updating the set of logged event types periodically is necessary to ensure that
  the current set remains necessary and sufficient."
