Title: "2.3 Access to all audit trails"
Description: "Malicious users often attempt to alter audit logs to hide their actions,
  and a record of access allows an organization to trace any inconsistencies or potential
  tampering of the logs to an individual account. Having access to logs identifying
  changes, additions, and deletions can help retrace steps made by unauthorized personnel.
  This control verifies access to all audit trails is logged."
