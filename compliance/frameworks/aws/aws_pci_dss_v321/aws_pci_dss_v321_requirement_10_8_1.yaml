Title: "8.1 Additional requirement for service providers only: Respond to failures
  of any critical security controls in a timely manner"
Description: "Processes for responding to failures in security controls must include
  restoring security functions, identifying and documenting the duration (date and
  time start to end) of the security failure, identifying and documenting cause(s)
  of failure, including root cause, and documenting remediation required to address
  root cause, identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the
  failure, performing a risk assessment to determine whether further actions are required
  as a result of the security failure, implementing controls to prevent cause of failure
  from reoccurring and resuming monitoring of security controls. Note: This requirement
  applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. If critical security
  control failures alerts are not quickly and effectively responded to, attackers
  may use this time to insert malicious software, gain control of a system, or steal
  data from the entity's environment. Documented evidence (e.g., records within
  a problem management system) should support that processes and procedures are in
  place to respond to security failures. In addition, personnel should be aware of
  their responsibilities in the event of a failure. Actions and responses to the failure
  should be captured in the documented evidence."
