Title: "3.a Examine written software-development processes to verify that the processes
  are based on industry standards and/or best practices"
Description: "Without the inclusion of security during the requirements definition,
  design, analysis, and testing phases of software development, security vulnerabilities
  can be inadvertently or maliciously introduced into the production environment.
  Understanding how sensitive data is handled by the application—including when stored,
  transmitted, and when in memory—can help identify where data needs to be protected."
