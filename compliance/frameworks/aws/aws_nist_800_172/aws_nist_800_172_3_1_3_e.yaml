Title: "1.3e Employ [Assignment: organization-defined secure information transfer
  solutions] to control information flows between security domains on connected systems"
Description: "Organizations employ information flow control policies and enforcement
  mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations
  within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics
  of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example,
  in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration
  settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based
  on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message
  content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection
  mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical
  to information flow enforcement. Transferring information between systems in different
  security domains with different security policies introduces the risk that the transfers
  violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners
  or information stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points
  between connected systems. Organizations mandate specific architectural solutions
  when required to enforce logical or physical separation between systems in different
  security domains. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between
  connected systems, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information
  flows, verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security
  domain or connected system, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to
  reassign security attributes and labels."
