Description: Represents a client-facing interface by which the client calls the API to access back-end resources. A Method resource is integrated with an Integration resource. Both consist of a request and one or more responses. The method request takes the client input that is passed to the back end through the integration request. A method response returns the output from the back end to the client through an integration response. A method request is embodied in a Method resource, whereas an integration request is embodied in an Integration resource. On the other hand, a method response is represented by a MethodResponse resource, whereas an integration response is represented by an IntegrationResponse resource.
