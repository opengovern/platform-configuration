  management for non-consumer users and administrators"
Description: "By ensuring each user is uniquely identified— instead of using one
  ID for several employees—an organization can maintain individual responsibility
  for actions and an effective audit trail per employee. This will help speed issue
  resolution and containment when misuse or malicious intent occurs."
