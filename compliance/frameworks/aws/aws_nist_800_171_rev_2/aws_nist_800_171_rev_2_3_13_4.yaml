Title: "13.4 Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared
  system resources"
Description: "The control of information in shared system resources (e.g., registers,
  cache memory, main memory, hard disks) is also commonly referred to as object reuse
  and residual information protection. This requirement prevents information produced
  by the actions of prior users or roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf
  of prior users or roles) from being available to any current users or roles (or
  current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access
  to shared system resources after those resources have been released back to the
  system. This requirement also applies to encrypted representations of information.
  This requirement does not address information remanence, which refers to residual
  representation of data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels (including
  storage or timing channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information
  flow restrictions; or components within systems for which there are only single
  users or roles."
