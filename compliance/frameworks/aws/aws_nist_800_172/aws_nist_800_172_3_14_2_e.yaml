Title: "14.2e Monitor organizational systems and system components on an ongoing
  basis for anomalous or suspicious behavior"
Description: "Monitoring is used to identify unusual, suspicious, or unauthorized
  activities or conditions related to organizational systems and system components.
  Such activities or conditions can include unusual internal systems communications
  traffic, unauthorized exporting of information,signaling to external systems, large
  file transfers, long-time persistent connections, attempts to access information
  from unexpected locations, unusual protocols and ports in use, and attempted communications
  with suspected malicious external addresses. The correlation of physical, time,
  or geolocation audit record information to the audit records from systems may assist
  organizations in identifying examples of anomalous behavior. For example, the correlation
  of an individualâ€™s identity for logical access to certain systems with the additional
  information that the individual was not present at the facility when the logical
  access occurred is indicative of anomalous behavior."
