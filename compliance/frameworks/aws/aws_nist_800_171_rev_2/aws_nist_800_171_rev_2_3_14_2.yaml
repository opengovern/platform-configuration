Title: "14.2 Provide protection from malicious code at designated locations within
  organizational systems"
Description: "Designated locations include system entry and exit points which may
  include firewalls, remoteaccess servers, workstations, electronic mail servers,
  web servers, proxy servers, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code
  includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded
  in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden
  files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code
  can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic
  mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code
  insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Malicious code
  protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputationbased
  technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate
  the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive
  software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized
  code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also
  be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors,
  and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business
  functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect
  such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including
  secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement
  processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform
  functions other than the functions intended."
