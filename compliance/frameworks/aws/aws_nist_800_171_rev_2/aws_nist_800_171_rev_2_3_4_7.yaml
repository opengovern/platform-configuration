Title: "4.7 Restrict, disable, or prevent the use of nonessential programs, functions,
  ports, protocols, and services"
Description: "Restricting the use of nonessential software (programs) includes restricting
  the roles allowed to approve program execution; prohibiting auto-execute; program
  blacklisting and whitelisting; or restricting the number of program instances executed
  at the same time. The organization makes a security-based determination which functions,
  ports, protocols, and/or services are restricted. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol
  (FTP), and peer-to-peer networking are examples of protocols organizations consider
  preventing the use of, restricting, or disabling."
