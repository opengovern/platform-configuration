title: Limit access to system components and cardholder data to only those individuals whose job requires such access
description: The more people who have access to cardholder data, the more risk there is that a user's account will be used maliciously. Limiting access to those with a legitimate business reason for the access helps an organization prevent mishandling of cardholder data through inexperience or malice.
