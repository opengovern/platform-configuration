Title: "1.4 Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity
  without collusion"
Description: "Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
  privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.
  Separation of duties includes dividing mission functions and system support functions
  among different individuals or roles; conducting system support functions with different
  individuals (e.g., configuration management, quality assurance and testing, system
  management, programming, and network security); and ensuring that security personnel
  administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because
  separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations
  consider the entirety of organizational systems and system components when developing
  policy on separation of duties."
