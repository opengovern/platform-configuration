Title: "5.2 Current audit trail files are protected from unauthorized modifications
  via access control mechanisms, physical segregation, and/or network segregation"
Description: "Adequate protection of the audit logs includes strong access control
  (limit access to logs based on “need to know” only), and use of physical or network
  segregation to make the logs harder to find and modify. Promptly backing up the
  logs to a centralized log server or media that is difficult to alter keeps the logs
  protected even if the system generating the logs becomes compromised. Protect audit
  trail files from unauthorized modifications."
