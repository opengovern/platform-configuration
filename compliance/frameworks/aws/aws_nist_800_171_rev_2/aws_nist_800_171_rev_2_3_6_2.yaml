Title: "6.2 Track, document, and report incidents to designated officials and/or
  authorities both internal and external to the organization"
Description: "Tracking and documenting system security incidents includes maintaining
  records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information
  necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident
  information can be obtained from a variety of sources including incident reports,
  incident response teams, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
  and user/administrator reports. Reporting incidents addresses specific incident
  reporting requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting
  requirements for the organization. Suspected security incidents may also be reported
  and include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially
  contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and
  timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, and policies."
