Title: "4.2e Employ automated mechanisms to detect misconfigured or unauthorized
  system components; after detection, [Selection (one or more): remove the components;
  place the components in a quarantine or remediation network] to facilitate patching,
  re-configuration, or other mitigations"
Description: "System components used to process, store, transmit, or protect CUI
  are monitored and checked against the authoritative source (i.e., hardware and software
  inventory and associated baseline configurations). From an automated assessment
  perspective, the system description provided by the authoritative source is referred
  to as the desired state. Using automated tools, the desired state is compared to
  the actual state to check for compliance or deviations. Security responses to system
  components that are unknown or that deviate from approved configurations can include
  removing the components; halting system functions or processing; placing the system
  components in a quarantine or remediation network that facilitates patching, re-configuration,
  or other mitigations; or issuing alerts and/or notifications to personnel when there
  is an unauthorized modification of an organization-defined configuration item. Responses
  can be automated, manual, or procedural. Components that are removed from the system
  are rebuilt from the trusted configuration baseline established by the authoritative
  source."
