Title: "Use intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques to detect
  and/or prevent intrusions into the network"
Description: "Monitor all traffic at the perimeter of the cardholder data environment
  as well as at critical points in the cardholder data environment, and alert personnel
  to suspected compromises. Keep all intrusion-detection and prevention engines, baselines,
  and signatures up to date. Intrusion detection and/or intrusion prevention techniques
  (such as IDS/IPS) compare the traffic coming into the network with known “signatures”
  and/or behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other
  malware), and send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it happens. Without a proactive
  approach to unauthorized activity detection, attacks on (or misuse of) computer
  resources could go unnoticed in real time. Security alerts generated by these techniques
  should be monitored so that the attempted intrusions can be stopped."
