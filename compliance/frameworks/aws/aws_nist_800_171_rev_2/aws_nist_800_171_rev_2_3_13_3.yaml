Title: "13.3 Separate user functionality from system management functionality"
Description: "System management functionality includes functions necessary to administer
  databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires
  privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from system management
  functionality is physical or logical. Organizations can implement separation of
  system management functionality from user functionality by using different computers,
  different central processing units, different instances of operating systems, or
  different network addresses; virtualization techniques; or combinations of these
  or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes web administrative
  interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other system
  resources. Separation of system and user functionality may include isolating administrative
  interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls."
