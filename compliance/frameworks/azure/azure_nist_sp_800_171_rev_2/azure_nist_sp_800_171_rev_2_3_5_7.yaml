Title: "5.7 Enforce a minimum password complexity and change of characters when new
  passwords are created"
Description: "This requirement applies to single-factor authentication of individuals
  using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner,
  when passwords are used as part of multifactor authenticators. The number of changed
  characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number
  of positions in the current password. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against
  passwords, organizations may also consider salting passwords."
