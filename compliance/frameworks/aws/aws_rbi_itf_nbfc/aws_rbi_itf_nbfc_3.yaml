Title: "Information Security"
Description: "Information is an asset to all NBFCs and Information Security (IS)
  refers to the protection of these assets in order to achieve organizational goals.
  The purpose of IS is to control access to sensitive information, ensuring use only
  by legitimate users so that data cannot be read or compromised without proper authorization.
  NBFCs must have a board approved IS Policy with the following basic tenets: a. Confidentiality
  - Ensuring access to sensitive data to authorized users only, b. Integrity - Ensuring
  accuracy and reliability of information by ensuring that there is no modification
  without authorization, c. Availability - Ensuring that uninterrupted data is available
  to users when it is needed, d. Authenticity - For IS it is necessary to ensure that
  the data, transactions, communications or documents (electronic or physical) are
  genuine."
