Title: "Implement audit trails to link all access to system components to each individual
  user"
Description: "It is critical to have a process or system that links user access to
  system components accessed. This system generates audit logs and provides the ability
  to trace back suspicious activity to a specific user. This control verifies, through
  observation and interviewing the system administrator, that: audit trails are enabled
  and active for system components, access to system components is linked to individual
  users."
