Title: "Ensure that all system components and software are protected from known vulnerabilities
  by installing applicable vendor- supplied security patches"
Description: "Install critical security patches within one month of release. Note:
  Critical security patches should be identified according to the risk ranking process
  defined in Requirement 6.1. There is a constant stream of attacks using widely published
  exploits, often called `zero day` (an attack that exploits a previously unknown
  vulnerability), against otherwise secured systems. If the most recent patches are
  not implemented on critical systems as soon as possible, a malicious individual
  can use these exploits to attack or disable a system, or gain access to sensitive
  data. Prioritizing patches for critical infrastructure ensures that high-priority
  systems and devices are protected from vulnerabilities as soon as possible after
  a patch is released. Consider prioritizing patch installations such that security
  patches for critical or at-risk systems are installed within 30 days, and other
  lower-risk patches are installed within 2-3 months. This requirement applies to
  applicable patches for all installed software, including payment applications (both
  those that are PA-DSS validated and those that are not)."
