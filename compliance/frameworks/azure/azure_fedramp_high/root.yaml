Title: "FedRAMP High"
Description: "The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is
  a U.S. Federal government program that provides a standardized approach to security
  assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.
  The FedRAMP program has helped to accelerate the adoption of secure cloud solutions
  through the reuse of assessments and authorizations across government agencies.
  FedRAMP leverages a standardized set of requirements, established in accordance
  with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), to improve consistency
  and confidence in the security of cloud solutions. Cloud Service Providers (CSP)
  that support U.S. government customers or operate on U.S. government information
  are responsible for complying with the requirements established by the FedRAMP program.
  In May 2020 the Salesforce Government Cloud Plus achieved a provisional Authority
  to Operate (ATO) at the high impact level issued by the FedRAMP Joint Authorization
  Board (JAB)."
