Title: "1.2 Limit system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized
  users are permitted to execute"
Description: "Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes
  by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. System account types include
  individual, shared, group, system, anonymous, guest, emergency, developer, manufacturer,
  vendor, and temporary. Other attributes required for authorizing access include
  restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-oforigin. In defining other
  account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., system
  upgrades scheduled maintenance,) and mission or business requirements, (e.g., time
  zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements)."
