Title: "200(a) Biometric electronic signature components and controls"
Description: "(a) Electronic signatures that are not based upon biometrics shall:
  (1) Employ at least two distinct identification components such as an identification
  code and password. (i) When an individual executes a series of signings during a
  single, continuous period of controlled system access, the first signing shall be
  executed using all electronic signature components; subsequent signings shall be
  executed using at least one electronic signature component that is only executable
  by, and designed to be used only by, the individual. (ii) When an individual executes
  one or more signings not performed during a single, continuous period of controlled
  system access, each signing shall be executed using all of the electronic signature
  components. (2) Be used only by their genuine owners; and (3) Be administered and
  executed to ensure that attempted use of an individual's electronic signature
  by anyone other than its genuine owner requires collaboration of two or more individuals."
