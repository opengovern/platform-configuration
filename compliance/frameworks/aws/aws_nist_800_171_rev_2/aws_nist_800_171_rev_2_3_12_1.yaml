Title: "12.1 Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems
  to determine if the controls are effective in their application"
Description: "Organizations assess security controls in organizational systems and
  the environments in which those systems operate as part of the system development
  life cycle. Security controls are the safeguards or countermeasures organizations
  implement to satisfy security requirements. By assessing the implemented security
  controls, organizations determine if the security safeguards or countermeasures
  are in place and operating as intended. Security control assessments ensure that
  information security is built into organizational systems; identify weaknesses and
  deficiencies early in the development process; provide essential information needed
  to make risk-based decisions; and ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation
  procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls as documented
  in system security plans."
