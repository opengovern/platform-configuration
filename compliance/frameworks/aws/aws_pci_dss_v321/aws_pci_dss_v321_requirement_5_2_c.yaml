Title: "2.c Examine a sample of system components, including all operating system
  types commonly affected by malicious software, to verify that the anti-virus software
  and definitions are current and periodic scans are performed"
Description: "Even the best anti-virus solutions are limited in effectiveness if
  they are not maintained and kept current with the latest security updates, signature
  files, or malware protections. Audit logs provide the ability to monitor virus and
  malware activity and anti-malware reactions. Thus, it is imperative that anti-malware
  solutions be configured to generate audit logs and that these logs be managed in
  accordance with Requirement 10."
