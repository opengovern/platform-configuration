Title: "5.4 Logs for external-facing technologies (for example, wireless, firewalls,
  DNS, mail) are written onto a secure, centralized, internal log server or media"
Description: "By writing logs from external-facing technologies such as wireless,
  firewalls, DNS, and mail servers, the risk of those logs being lost or altered is
  lowered, as they are more secure within the internal network. Logs may be written
  directly, or offloaded or copied from external systems, to the secure internal system
  or media."
