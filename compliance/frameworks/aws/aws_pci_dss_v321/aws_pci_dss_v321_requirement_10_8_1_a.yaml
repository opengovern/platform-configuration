Title: "8.1.a Examine documented policies and procedures and interview personnel
  to verify processes are defined and implemented to respond to a security control
  failure"
Description: "This include restoring security functions, identifying and documenting
  the duration (date and time start to end) of the security failure, identifying and
  documenting cause(s) of failure, including root cause, and documenting remediation
  required to address root cause, identifying and addressing any security issues that
  arose during the failure, performing a risk assessment to determine whether further
  actions are required as a result of the security failure, implementing controls
  to prevent cause of failure from reoccurring and resuming monitoring of security
  controls. Note: This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is
  a service provider. If critical security control failures alerts are not quickly
  and effectively responded to, attackers may use this time to insert malicious software,
  gain control of a system, or steal data from the entity's environment. Documented
  evidence (e.g., records within a problem management system) should support that
  processes and procedures are in place to respond to security failures. In addition,
  personnel should be aware of their responsibilities in the event of a failure. Actions
  and responses to the failure should be captured in the documented evidence."
