Title: "14.7e Verify the correctness of [Assignment: organization-defined security
  critical or essential software, firmware, and hardware components] using [Assignment:
  organization-defined verification methods or techniques]."
Description: "Verification methods have varying degrees of rigor in determining the
  correctness of software, firmware, and hardware components. For example, formal
  verification involves proving that a software program satisfies some formal property
  or set of properties. The nature of formal verification is generally time-consuming
  and not employed for commercial operating systems and applications. Therefore, it
  would likely only be applied to some very limited uses, such as verifying cryptographic
  protocols. However, in cases where software, firmware, or hardware components exist
  with formal verification of the componentâ€™s security properties, such components
  provide greater assurance and trustworthiness and are preferred over similar components
  that have not been formally verified."
