Title: "For a sample of system components including all operating system types commonly
  affected by malicious software, verify that anti-virus software is deployed if applicable
  anti-virus technology exists"
Description: "There is a constant stream of attacks using widely published exploits,
  often called `zero day` (an attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability),
  against otherwise secured systems. Without an anti-virus solution that is updated
  regularly, these new forms of malicious software can attack systems, disable a network,
  or lead to compromise of data."
