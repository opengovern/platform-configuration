Description: Use a customer-managed key to control the encryption at rest of the data stored 
  in Azure API for FHIR when this is a regulatory or compliance requirement. Customer-managed 
  keys also deliver double encryption by adding a second layer of encryption on top of the 
  default one done with service-managed keys.
