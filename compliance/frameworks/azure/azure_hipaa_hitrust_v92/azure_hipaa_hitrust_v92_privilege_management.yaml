Title: "Privilege Management"
Description: "Privilege management is a crucial aspect of HIPAA and HITRUST compliance,
  focusing on access control to protect sensitive health information. It involves
  implementing role-based access controls, strong authentication measures, regular
  reviews of access privileges, and robust logging and monitoring systems. By enforcing
  these measures, organizations can ensure that only authorized individuals have appropriate
  access to electronic protected health information, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  disclosure and maintaining compliance with HIPAA and HITRUST standards."
