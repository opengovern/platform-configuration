Title: "5.2 Authenticate (or verify) the identities of users, processes, or devices,
  as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational systems"
Description: "Individual authenticators include the following: passwords, key cards,
  cryptographic devices, and one-time password devices. Initial authenticator content
  is the actual content of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In
  contrast, the requirements about authenticator content include the minimum password
  length. Developers ship system components with factory default authentication credentials
  to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials
  are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk.
  Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions
  for various authenticator characteristics including minimum password length, validation
  time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections
  during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Authenticator management
  includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary
  access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include
  certificates and passwords."
