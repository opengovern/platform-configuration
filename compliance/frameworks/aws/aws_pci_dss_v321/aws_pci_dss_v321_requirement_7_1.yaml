Title: "Limit access to system components and cardholder data to only those individuals
  whose job requires such access"
Description: "The more people who have access to cardholder data, the more risk there
  is that a user's account will be used maliciously. Limiting access to those
  with a legitimate business reason for the access helps an organization prevent mishandling
  of cardholder data through inexperience or malice."
