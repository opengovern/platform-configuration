Description: You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. Security Hub recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for changes to S3 bucket policies. Monitoring these changes might reduce time to detect and correct permissive policies on sensitive S3 buckets.
