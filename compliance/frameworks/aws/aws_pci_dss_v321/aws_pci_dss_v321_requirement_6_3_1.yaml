Title: "3.1 Examine written software-development procedures and interview responsible
  personnel to verify that pre-production and/or custom application accounts, user
  IDs and/or passwords are removed before an application goes into production or is
  released to customers"
Description: "Development, test and/or custom application accounts, user IDs, and
  passwords should be removed from production code before the application becomes
  active or is released to customers, since these items may give away information
  about the functioning of the application. Possession of such information could facilitate
  compromise of the application and related cardholder data."
