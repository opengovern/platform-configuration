Title: "13.16 Protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest"
Description: "Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not
  in process or in transit and is located on storage devices as specific components
  of systems. The focus of protection at rest is not on the type of storage device
  or the frequency of access but rather the state of the information. Organizations
  can use different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality protections, including the
  use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Organizations may also
  use other controls including secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when
  adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved or continuous
  monitoring to identify malicious code at rest."
