Title: "2.3 Do not store the personal identification number (PIN) or the encrypted
  PIN block after authorization"

  the card. If this data is stolen, malicious individuals can execute fraudulent PIN-based
  debit transactions (for example, ATM withdrawals). For a sample of system components,
  examine data sources, including but not limited to the following and verify that
  PINs and encrypted PIN blocks are not stored after authorization: incoming transaction
  data, all logs (for example, transaction, history, debugging, error), history files,
  trace files, several database schemas, database contents"
