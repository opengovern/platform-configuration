Title: "Fully document and implement all key-management processes and procedures
  for cryptographic keys used for encryption of cardholder data"
Description: "Note: Numerous industry standards for key management are available
  from various resources including NIST, which can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov.
  The manner in which cryptographic keys are managed is a critical part of the continued
  security of the encryption solution. A good key- management process, whether it
  is manual or automated as part of the encryption product, is based on industry standards
  and addresses all key elements at 3.6.1 through 3.6.8. Providing guidance to customers
  on how to securely transmit, store and update cryptographic keys can help prevent
  keys from being mismanaged or disclosed to unauthorized entities. This requirement
  applies to keys used to encrypt stored cardholder data, and any respective key-
  encrypting keys. Note: Testing Procedure 3.6.a is an additional procedure that only
  applies if the entity being assessed is a service provider."
