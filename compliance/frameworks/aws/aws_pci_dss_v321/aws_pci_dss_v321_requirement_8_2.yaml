Title: "To verify that users are authenticated using unique ID and additional authentication
  (for example, a password/phrase) for access to the cardholder data environment perform
  the methods like examine documentation describing the authentication method(s) used
  etc"
Description: "Verify users are authenticated using unique ID, perform the following:
  examine documentation describing the authentication method(s) used, for each type
  of authentication method used and for each type of system component, observe an
  authentication to verify authentication is functioning consistent with documented
  authentication method(s). These authentication methods, when used in addition to
  unique IDs, help protect users' IDs from being compromised, since the one
  attempting the compromise needs to know both the unique ID and the password (or
  other authentication used). Note that a digital certificate is a valid option for
  “something you have” as long as it is unique for a particular user. Since one of
  the first steps a malicious individual will take to compromise a system is to exploit
  weak or nonexistent passwords, it is important to implement good processes for authentication
  management."
