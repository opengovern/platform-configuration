Title: "Document and implement procedures to protect keys used to secure stored cardholder
  data against disclosure and misuse"
Description: "Note: This requirement applies to keys used to encrypt stored cardholder
  data, and also applies to key-encrypting keys used to protect data-encrypting keysâ€”such
  key- encrypting keys must be at least as strong as the data-encrypting key. Cryptographic
  keys must be strongly protected because those who obtain access will be able to
  decrypt data. Key-encrypting keys, if used, must be at least as strong as the data-encrypting
  key in order to ensure proper protection of the key that encrypts the data as well
  as the data encrypted with that key. The requirement to protect keys from disclosure
  and misuse applies to both data-encrypting keys and key-encrypting keys. Because
  one key- encrypting key may grant access to many data- encrypting keys, the key-encrypting
  keys require strong protection measures."
