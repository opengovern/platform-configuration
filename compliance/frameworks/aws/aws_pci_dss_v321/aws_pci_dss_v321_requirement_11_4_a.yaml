Title: "4.a Examine system configurations and network diagrams to verify that techniques
  (such as intrusion-detection systems and/or intrusion-prevention systems) are in
  place to monitor all traffic at the perimeter of the cardholder data environment
  and at critical points in the cardholder data environment"
Description: "Intrusion detection and/or intrusion prevention techniques (such as
  IDS/IPS) compare the traffic coming into the network with known “signatures” and/or
  behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware),
  and send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it happens. Without a proactive approach
  to unauthorized activity detection, attacks on (or misuse of) computer resources
  could go unnoticed in real time. Security alerts generated by these techniques should
  be monitored so that the attempted intrusions can be stopped."
