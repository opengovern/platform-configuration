Title: "3.11 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to Network Access Control Lists (NACL)"
Description: "Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. NACLs are used as a stateless packet filter to control ingress and egress traffic for subnets within a VPC. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to NACLs."
