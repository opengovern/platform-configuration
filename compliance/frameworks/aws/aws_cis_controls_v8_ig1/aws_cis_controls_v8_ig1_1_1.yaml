Title: "Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory"
Description: "Establish and maintain an accurate, detailed, and up-to-date inventory
  of all enterprise assets with the potential to store or process data, to include:
  end-user devices (including portable and mobile), network devices, non-computing/IoT
  devices, and servers. Ensure the inventory records the network address (if static),
  hardware address, machine name, enterprise asset owner, department for each asset,
  and whether the asset has been approved to connect to the network. For mobile end-user
  devices, MDM type tools can support this process, where appropriate. This inventory
  includes assets connected to the infrastructure physically, virtually, remotely,
  and those within cloud environments. Additionally, it includes assets that are regularly
  connected to the enterpriseâ€™s network infrastructure, even if they are not under
  control of the enterprise. Review and update the inventory of all enterprise assets
  bi-annually, or more frequently."
