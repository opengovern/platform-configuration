Title: "Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove or disable unnecessary
  default accounts before installing a system on the network"
Description: "This applies to ALL default passwords, including but not limited to
  those used by operating systems, software that provides security services, application
  and system accounts, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications, Simple
  Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community strings, etc. Malicious individuals
  (external and internal to an organization) often use vendor default settings, account
  names, and passwords to compromise operating system software, applications, and
  the systems on which they are installed. Because these default settings are often
  published and are well known in hacker communities, changing these settings will
  leave systems less vulnerable to attack. Even if a default account is not intended
  to be used, changing the default password to a strong unique password and then disabling
  the account will prevent a malicious individual from re-enabling the account and
  gaining access with the default password."
