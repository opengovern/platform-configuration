Title: "Additional requirement for service providers only to implement a process
  for the timely detection and reporting of failures of critical security control
  systems, including but not limited to failure of firewalls, IDS/IPS, FIM, anti-virus,
  physical access controls, logical access controls, audit logging mechanisms and
  segmentation controls"
Description: "Note: This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed
  is a service provider. Without formal processes to detect and alert when critical
  security controls fail, failures may go undetected for extended periods and provide
  attackers ample time to compromise systems and steal sensitive data from the cardholder
  data environment. The specific types of failures may vary depending on the function
  of the device and technology in use. Typical failures include a system ceasing to
  perform its security function or not functioning in its intended manner; for example,
  a firewall erasing all its rules or going offline."
