Title: "1.16 Ensure IAM policies that allow full \\\"*:*\\\" administrative privileges are not attached"
Description: "IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilege -that is, granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks, instead of allowing full administrative privileges."
