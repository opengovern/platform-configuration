Title: "14.6e Use threat indicator information and effective mitigations obtained
  from [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] to guide and inform
  intrusion detection and threat hunting"
Description: "Threat information related to specific threat events (e.g., TTPs, targets)
  that organizations have experienced, threat mitigations that organizations have
  found to be effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence
  (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that can occur) are sourced from and
  shared with trusted organizations. This threat information can be used by organizational
  Security Operations Centers (SOC) and incorporated into monitoring capabilities.
  Threat information sharing includes threat indicators, signatures, and adversary
  TTPs from organizations participating in threat-sharing consortia, government-commercial
  cooperatives, and government-government cooperatives (e.g., CERTCC, CISA/US-CERT,
  FIRST, ISAO, DIB CS Program). Unclassified indicators, based on classified information
  but which can be readily incorporated into organizational intrusion detection systems,
  are available to qualified nonfederal organizations from government sources."
