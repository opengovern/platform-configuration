Title: "2.3.b Verify that the firewalls deny or, if traffic is necessary for business
  purposes, permit only authorized traffic between the wireless environment and the
  cardholder data environment"
Description: "The known (or unknown) implementation and exploitation of wireless
  technology within a network is a common path for malicious individuals to gain access
  to the network and cardholder data. If a wireless device or network is installed
  without the entity's knowledge, a malicious individual could easily and “invisibly”
  enter the network. If firewalls do not restrict access from wireless networks into
  the CDE, malicious individuals that gain unauthorized access to the wireless network
  can easily connect to the CDE and compromise account information. Firewalls must
  be installed between all wireless networks and the CDE, regardless of the purpose
  of the environment to which the wireless network is connected. This may include,
  but is not limited to, corporate networks, retail stores, guest networks, warehouse
  environments, etc."
