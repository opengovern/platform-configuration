title: 3.1 Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports
description: The DMZ is that part of the network that manages connections between the Internet (or other untrusted networks), and services that an organization needs to have available to the public (like a web server). This functionality is intended to prevent malicious individuals from accessing the organization's internal network from the Internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner. The set of controls will examine firewall and router configurations to verify that a DMZ is implemented to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.
