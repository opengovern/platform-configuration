Title: "VPC security groups should restrict ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to oracle ports 1521 or 2483"
Description: "This control checks whether the VPC security groups that are in use allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to oracle ports 1521 or 2483. Optionally the rule checks whether the port numbers are listed in the authorizedTcpPorts parameter. This control passes when none of the rules in a security group allow ingress traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 from ports 1521 or 2483."
