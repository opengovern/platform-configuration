Title: "13.15 Protect the authenticity of communications sessions"
Description: "Authenticity protection includes protecting against man-in-the-middle
  attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into communications
  sessions. This requirement addresses communications protection at the session versus
  packet level (e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based
  services) and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications
  sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information
  transmitted."
