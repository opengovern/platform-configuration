  title: "11.1e Employ [Assignment: organization-defined sources of threat intelligence] as part of a risk assessment to guide and inform the development of organizational systems, security architectures, selection of security solutions, monitoring, threat hunting, and response and recovery activities"
  description: The constant evolution and increased sophistication of adversaries, especially the APT, makes it more likely that adversaries can successfully compromise or breach organizational systems. Accordingly, threat intelligence can be integrated into each step of the risk management process throughout the system development life cycle. This risk management process includes defining system security requirements, developing system and security architectures, selecting security solutions, monitoring (including threat hunting), and remediation efforts.
