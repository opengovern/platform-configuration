Title: "2.2.b Examine router configurations to verify they are synchronizedâ€”for example,
  the running (or active) configuration matches the start-up configuration (used when
  machines are booted)"
Description: "While the running (or active) router configuration files include the
  current, secure settings, the start- up files (which are used when routers are re-
  started or booted) must be updated with the same secure settings to ensure these
  settings are applied when the start-up configuration is run. Because they only run
  occasionally, start-up configuration files are often forgotten and are not updated.
  When a router re-starts and loads a start-up configuration that has not been updated
  with the same secure settings as those in the running configuration, it may result
  in weaker rules that allow malicious individuals into the network."
