Title: "14.7 Identify unauthorized use of organizational systems"
Description: "System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. System
  monitoring can detect unauthorized use of organizational systems. System monitoring
  is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Monitoring
  is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection
  systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning
  tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Output from
  system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response
  programs. Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound
  communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious
  code in systems or propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting
  of information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is
  used to identify potentially compromised systems or system components. System monitoring
  requirements, including the need for specific types of system monitoring, may be
  referenced in other requirements."
