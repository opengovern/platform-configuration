Title: "5.3 Use multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged
  accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts"
Description: "Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different
  factors to authenticate. The factors are defined as something you know (e.g., password,
  personal identification number [PIN]); something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification
  device, token); or something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor authentication
  solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators providing
  time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards. In addition to
  authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may also
  employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide
  increased information security. Access to organizational systems is defined as local
  access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by
  users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by
  direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to systems
  by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained
  through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of
  network access that involves communication through external networks. The use of
  encrypted virtual private networks for connections between organization-controlled
  and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with
  regard to protecting the confidentiality of information."
