Title: "Cyber Crisis Management Plan"
Description: "A Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP) should be immediately evolved
  and should be a part of the overall Board approved strategy. CCMP should address
  the following four aspects: (i) Detection (ii) Response (iii) Recovery and (iv)
  Containment. NBFCs need to take effective measures to prevent cyber-attacks and
  to promptly detect any cyber-intrusions so as to respond / recover / contain the
  fall out. NBFCs are expected to be well prepared to face emerging cyber-threats
  such as ‘zero-day’ attacks, remote access threats, and targeted attacks. Among other
  things, NBFCs should take necessary preventive and corrective measures in addressing
  various types of cyber threats including, but not limited to, denial of service,
  distributed denial of services (DDoS), ransom-ware / crypto ware, destructive malware,
  business email frauds including spam, email phishing, spear phishing, whaling, vishing
  frauds, drive-by downloads, browser gateway fraud, ghost administrator exploits,
