  title: 2.2 Secure and synchronize router configuration files
  description: While the running (or active) router configuration files include the current, secure settings, the start- up files (which are used when routers are re- started or booted) must be updated with the same secure settings to ensure these settings are applied when the start-up configuration is run. Because they only run occasionally, start-up configuration files are often forgotten and are not updated. When a router re-starts and loads a start-up configuration that has not been updated with the same secure settings as those in the running configuration, it may result in weaker rules that allow malicious individuals into the network.
