Title: "01q2System.4-01.q 01.05 Operating System Access Control"
Description: "When PKI-based authentication is used, the information system validates
  certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust
  anchor, including checking certificate status information; enforces access to the
  corresponding private key; maps the identity to the corresponding account of the
  individual or group; and implements a local cache of revocation data to support
  path discovery and validation in case of an inability to access revocation information
  via the network."
