Title: "Develop internal and external software applications (including web-based
  administrative access to applications) securely"
Description: "Develop internal and external software application securely as follows:
  in accordance with PCI DSS (for example, secure authentication and logging), based
  on industry standards and/or best practices, incorporating information security
  throughout the software-development life cycle. Note: this applies to all software
  developed internally as well as bespoke or custom software developed by a third
  party. Without the inclusion of security during the requirements definition, design,
  analysis, and testing phases of software development, security vulnerabilities can
  be inadvertently or maliciously introduced into the production environment. Understanding
  how sensitive data is handled by the application—including when stored, transmitted,
  and when in memory—can help identify where data needs to be protected."
