Title: "12.4 Develop, document, and periodically update system security plans that
  describe system boundaries, system environments of operation, how security requirements
  are implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems"
Description: "System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security
  controls. System security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security
  controls meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical
  descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls. System security plans
  contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously
  compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk if
  the plan is implemented as intended. Security plans need not be single documents;
  the plans can be a collection of various documents including documents that already
  exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures,
  and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where
  more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements
  associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in
  other established management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture,
  system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. Federal agencies
  may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical
  inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI
  on a system hosted by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue
  an agreement or contract with the nonfederal organization."
