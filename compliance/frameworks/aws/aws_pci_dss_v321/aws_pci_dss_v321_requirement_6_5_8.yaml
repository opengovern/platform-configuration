Title: "5.8 Examine software-development policies and procedures and interview responsible
  personnel to verify that improper access control—such as insecure direct object
  references, failure to restrict URL access, and directory traversal—is addressed
  by coding technique"
Description: "Directory traversal—is addressed by coding technique should include:
  proper authentication of users, sanitizing input, not exposing internal object references
  to users and user interfaces that do not permit access to unauthorized functions.
  A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal
  implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a
  URL or form parameter. Attackers can manipulate those references to access other
  objects without authorization. Consistently enforce access control in presentation
  layer and business logic for all URLs. Frequently, the only way an application protects
  sensitive functionality is by preventing the display of links or URLs to unauthorized
  users. Attackers can use this weakness to access and perform unauthorized operations
  by accessing those URLs directly. An attacker may be able to enumerate and navigate
  the directory structure of a website (directory traversal) thus gaining access to
  unauthorized information as well as gaining further insight into the workings of
  the site for later exploitation. If user interfaces permit access to unauthorized
  functions, this access could result in unauthorized individuals gaining access to
  privileged credentials or cardholder data. Only authorized users should be permitted
  to access direct object references to sensitive resources. Limiting access to data
  resources will help prevent cardholder data from being presented to unauthorized
  resources."
