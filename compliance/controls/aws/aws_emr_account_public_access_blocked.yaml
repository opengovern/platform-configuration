Title: "EMR public access should be blocked at account level"
Description: "The block public access feature prevents a cluster in a public subnet from launching when any security group associated with the cluster has a rule that allows inbound traffic from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 or IPv6 ::/0 (public access) on a port, unless the port has been specified as an exception - port 22 is an exception by default. This feature is enabled by default for each AWS Region in your AWS account and is not recommended to be turned off."
