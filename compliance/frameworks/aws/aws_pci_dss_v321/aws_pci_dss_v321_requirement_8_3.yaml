Title: "Secure all individual non-console administrative access and all remote access
  to the CDE using multi-factor authentication"
Description: "Note: Multi-factor authentication requires that a minimum of two of
  the three authentication methods (see Requirement 8.2 for descriptions of authentication
  methods) be used for authentication. Using one factor twice (for example, using
  two separate passwords) is not considered multi-factor authentication. Multi-factor
  authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms
  of authentication (as described in Requirement 8.2), before access is granted. Multi-factor
  authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain
  access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would
  need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing
  the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk. Multi-factor authentication
  is not required at both the system-level and application-level for a particular
  system component. Multi-factor authentication can be performed either upon authentication
  to the particular network or to the system component. Examples of multi-factor technologies
  include but are not limited to remote authentication and dial-in service (RADIUS)
  with tokens; terminal access controller access control system (TACACS) with tokens;
  and other technologies that facilitate multi- factor authentication."
