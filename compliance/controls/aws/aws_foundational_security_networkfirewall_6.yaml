Title: "6 Stateless network firewall rule group should not be empty"
Description: "A rule group contains rules that define how your firewall processes traffic in your VPC. An empty stateless rule group when present in a firewall policy might give the impression that the rule group will process traffic. However, when the stateless rule group is empty, it does not process traffic."
