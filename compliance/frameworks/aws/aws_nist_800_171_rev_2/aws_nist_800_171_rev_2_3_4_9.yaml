Title: "4.9 Control and monitor user-installed software"
Description: "Users can install software in organizational systems if provided the
  necessary privileges. To maintain control over the software installed, organizations
  identify permitted and prohibited actions regarding software installation through
  policies. Permitted software installations include updates and security patches
  to existing software and applications from organization-approved 'app stores.'
  Prohibited software installations may include software with unknown or suspect pedigrees
  or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. The policies organizations
  select governing user-installed software may be organization-developed or provided
  by some external entity. Policy enforcement methods include procedural methods,
  automated methods, or both."
