Title: "User Identification and Authentication"
Description: "User identification and authentication play a crucial role. This involves
  implementing strong measures to verify the identity of users accessing electronic
  protected health information (ePHI). To comply with these standards, organizations
  should establish unique user IDs and enforce the use of strong passwords or passphrases.
  Additionally, implementing multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security
  by requiring users to provide additional verification, such as a code sent to their
  mobile device, in addition to their login credentials. By implementing robust user
  identification and authentication practices, organizations can ensure that only
  authorized individuals can access ePHI, reducing the risk of unauthorized disclosure
  and maintaining compliance with HIPAA and HITRUST 9.2 regulations."
