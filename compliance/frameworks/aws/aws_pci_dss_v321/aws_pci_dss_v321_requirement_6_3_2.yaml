Title: "3.2 Review custom code prior to release to production or customers in order
  to identify any potential coding vulnerability (using either manual or automated
  processes)"
Description: "Custom code prior to release to production should include the following:
  code changes are reviewed by individuals other than the originating code author,
  and by individuals knowledgeable about code-review techniques and secure coding
  practices, code reviews ensure code is developed according to secure coding guidelines,
  appropriate corrections are implemented prior to release, code-review results are
  reviewed and approved by management prior to release and security vulnerabilities
  in custom code are commonly exploited by malicious individuals to gain access to
  a network and compromise cardholder data. An individual knowledgeable and experienced
  in code-review techniques should be involved in the review process. Code reviews
  should be performed by someone other than the developer of the code to allow for
  an independent, objective review. Automated tools or processes may also be used
  in lieu of manual reviews, but keep in mind that it may be difficult or even impossible
  for an automated tool to identify some coding issues. Correcting coding errors before
  the code is deployed into a production environment or released to customers prevents
  the code exposing the environments to potential exploit. Faulty code is also far
  more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed or released into
  production environments. Including a formal review and signoff by management prior
  to release helps to ensure that code is approved and has been developed in accordance
  with policies and procedures."
