Description: This control checks whether AWS DMS replication instances are public. To do this, it examines the value of the PubliclyAccessible field. A private replication instance has a private IP address that you cannot access outside of the replication network. A replication instance should have a private IP address when the source and target databases are in the same network. The network must also be connected to the replication instance's VPC using a VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering. To learn more about public and private replication instances, see Public and private replication instances in the AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.
