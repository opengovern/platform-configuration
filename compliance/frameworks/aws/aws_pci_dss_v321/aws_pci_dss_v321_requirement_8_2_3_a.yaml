Title: "2.3.a For a sample of system components, inspect system configuration settings
  to verify that user password/passphrase parameters are set to require at least the
  following strength/complexity that is require a minimum length of at least seven
  characters and contain both numeric and alphabetic characters"
Description: "Strong passwords/passphrases are the first line of defense into a network
  since a malicious individual will often first try to find accounts with weak or
  non- existent passwords. If passwords are short or simple to guess, it is relatively
  easy for a malicious individual to find these weak accounts and compromise a network
  under the guise of a valid user ID. This requirement specifies that a minimum of
  seven characters and both numeric and alphabetic characters should be used for passwords/
  passphrases. For cases where this minimum cannot be met due to technical limitations,
  entities can use “equivalent strength” to evaluate their alternative. For information
  on variability and equivalency of password strength (also referred to as entropy)
  for passwords/passphrases of different formats, refer to industry standards (e.g.,
  the current version of NIST SP 800-63.) Note: Testing Procedure 8.2.3.b is an additional
  procedure that only applies if the entity being assessed is a service provider."
