Title: "2.1 Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for
  the cardholder data environment, and specifically deny all other traffic"
Description: "Examination of all inbound and outbound connections allows for inspection
  and restriction of traffic based on the source and/or destination address, thus
  preventing unfiltered access between untrusted and trusted environments. This prevents
  malicious individuals from accessing the entity's network via unauthorized
  IP addresses or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner
  (for example, to send data they've obtained from within the entity's
  network out to an untrusted server). Implementing a rule that denies all inbound
  and outbound traffic that is not specifically needed helps to prevent inadvertent
  holes that would allow unintended and potentially harmful traffic in or out."
