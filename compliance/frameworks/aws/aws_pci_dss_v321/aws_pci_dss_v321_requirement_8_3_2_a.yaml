Title: "3.2.a Examine system configurations for remote access servers and systems
  to verify multi-factor authentication is required for all remote access by personnel,
  both user and administrator, and all third-party/vendor remote access (including
  access to applications and system components for support or maintenance purposes)"
Description: "This requirement is intended to apply to all personnel—including general
  users, administrators, and vendors (for support or maintenance) with remote access
  to the network—where that remote access could lead to access to the CDE. If remote
  access is to an entity's network that has appropriate segmentation, such
  that remote users cannot access or impact the cardholder data environment, multi-factor
  authentication for remote access to that network would not be required. However,
  multi- factor authentication is required for any remote access to networks with
  access to the cardholder data environment, and is recommended for all remote access
  to the entity's networks."
