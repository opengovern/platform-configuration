Title: "5.a Verify the use of a change-detection mechanism by observing system settings
  and monitored files, as well as reviewing results from monitoring activities"
Description: "Examples of files that should be monitored are system executables,
  application executables, configuration and parameter files, centrally stored, historical
  or archived, log and audit files and additional critical files determined by entity
  (for example, through risk assessment or other means). Change-detection solutions
  such as file-integrity monitoring (FIM) tools check for changes, additions, and
  deletions to critical files, and notify when such changes are detected. If not implemented
  properly and the output of the change-detection solution monitored, a malicious
  individual could add, remove, or alter configuration file contents, operating system
  programs, or application executables. Unauthorized changes, if undetected, could
  render existing security controls ineffective and/or result in cardholder data being
  stolen with no perceptible impact to normal processing."
