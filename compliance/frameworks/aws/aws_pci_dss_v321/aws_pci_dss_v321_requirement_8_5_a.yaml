Title: "5.a For a sample of system components, examine user ID lists to verify that
  generic user IDs are disabled or removed, shared user IDs for system administration
  activities and other critical functions do not exist or are shared, and generic
  user IDs are not used to administer any system components"
Description: "Generic user IDs are disabled or removed.  Shared user IDs for system
  administration activities and other critical functions do not exist.  Shared and
  generic user IDs are not used to administer any system components. If multiple users
  share the same authentication credentials (for example, user account and password),
  it becomes impossible to trace system access and activities to an individual. This
  in turn prevents an entity from assigning accountability for, or having effective
  logging of, an individual's actions, since a given action could have been
  performed by anyone in the group that has knowledge of the authentication credentials."
