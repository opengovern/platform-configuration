Title: "5.1 Identify system users, processes acting on behalf of users, and devices"
Description: "Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC), Internet
  Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual
  identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers
  are the user names associated with the system accounts assigned to those individuals.
  Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts
  or for detailed accountability of individual activity. In addition, this requirement
  addresses individual identifiers that are not necessarily associated with system
  accounts. Organizational devices requiring identification may be defined by type,
  by device, or by a combination of type/device."
