Title: "1 IAM policies should not allow full '*' administrative privileges"
Description: "This control checks whether the default version of IAM policies (also known as customer managed policies) has administrator access that includes a statement with 'Effect': 'Allow' with 'Action': '*' over 'Resource': '*'. The control only checks the customer managed policies that you create. It does not check inline and AWS managed policies."
