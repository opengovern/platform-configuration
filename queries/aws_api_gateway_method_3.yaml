Description: Represents a client-facing interface by which the client calls the API
  to access back-end resources. A Method resource is integrated with an Integration
  resource. Both consist of a request and one or more responses. The method request
  takes the client input that is passed to the back end through the integration request.
  A method response returns the output from the back end to the client through an
  integration response. A method request is embodied in a Method resource, whereas
  an integration request is embodied in an Integration resource. On the other hand,
  a method response is represented by a MethodResponse resource, whereas an integration
  response is represented by an IntegrationResponse resource.
