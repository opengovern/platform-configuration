Title: "Encrypt all non-console administrative access using strong cryptography"
Description: "If non-console (including remote) administration does not use secure
  authentication and encrypted communications, sensitive administrative or operational
  level information (like administrator's IDs and passwords) can be revealed
  to an eavesdropper. A malicious individual could use this information to access
  the network, become administrator, and steal data. Clear-text protocols (such as
  HTTP, telnet, etc.) do not encrypt traffic or logon details, making it easy for
  an eavesdropper to intercept this information. Select a sample of system components
  and verify that non-console administrative access is encrypted."
