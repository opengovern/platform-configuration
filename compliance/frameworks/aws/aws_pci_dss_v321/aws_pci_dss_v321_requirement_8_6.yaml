Title: "Where other authentication mechanisms are used (for example, physical or
  logical security tokens, smart cards, certificates, etc.), use of these mechanisms
  must be assigned authentication mechanisms must be assigned to an individual account
  and not shared among multiple accounts, physical and/or logical controls must be
  in place to ensure only the intended account can use that mechanism to gain access"
Description: "If user authentication mechanisms such as tokens, smart cards, and
  certificates can be used by multiple accounts, it may be impossible to identify
  the individual using the authentication mechanism. Having physical and/or logical
  controls (for example, a PIN, biometric data, or a password) to uniquely identify
  the user of the account will prevent unauthorized users from gaining access through
  use of a shared authentication mechanism."
