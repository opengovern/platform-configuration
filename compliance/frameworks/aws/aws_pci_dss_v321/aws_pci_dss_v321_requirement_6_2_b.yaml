Title: "2.b For a sample of system components and related software, compare the list
  of security patches installed on each system to the most recent vendor security-patch
  list, to verify that the applicable critical vendor-supplied security patches are
  installed within one month of release, all applicable vendor-supplied security patches
  are installed within an appropriate time frame (for example, within three months)"
Description: "There is a constant stream of attacks using widely published exploits,
  often called `zero day` (an attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability),
  against otherwise secured systems. If the most recent patches are not implemented
  on critical systems as soon as possible, a malicious individual can use these exploits
  to attack or disable a system, or gain access to sensitive data. Prioritizing patches
  for critical infrastructure ensures that high-priority systems and devices are protected
  from vulnerabilities as soon as possible after a patch is released. Consider prioritizing
  patch installations such that security patches for critical or at-risk systems are
  installed within 30 days, and other lower-risk patches are installed within 2-3
  months. This requirement applies to applicable patches for all installed software,
  including payment applications (both those that are PA-DSS validated and those that
  are not)."
