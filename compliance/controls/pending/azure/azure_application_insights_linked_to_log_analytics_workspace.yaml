Description: Link the Application Insights component to a Log Analytics workspace for logs encryption. Customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance and for more control over the access to your data in Azure Monitor. Linking your component to a Log Analytics workspace that's enabled with a customer-managed key, ensures that your Application Insights logs meet this compliance requirement, see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/customer-managed-keys.
