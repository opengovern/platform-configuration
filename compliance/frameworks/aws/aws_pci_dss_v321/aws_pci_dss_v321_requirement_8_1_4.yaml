title: 1.4 Observe user accounts to verify that any inactive accounts over 90 days old are either removed or disabled
description: Accounts that are not used regularly are often targets of attack since it is less likely that any changes (such as a changed password) will be noticed. As such, these accounts may be more easily exploited and used to access cardholder data.
