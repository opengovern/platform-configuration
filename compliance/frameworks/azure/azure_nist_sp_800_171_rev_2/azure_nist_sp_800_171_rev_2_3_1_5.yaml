Title: "1.5 Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security
  functions and privileged accounts"
Description: "Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific
  duties and authorized accesses for users and processes. The principle of least privilege
  is applied with the goal of authorized privileges no higher than necessary to accomplish
  required organizational missions or business functions. Organizations consider the
  creation of additional processes, roles, and system accounts as necessary, to achieve
  least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation,
  and operation of organizational systems. Security functions include establishing
  system accounts, setting events to be logged, setting intrusion detection parameters,
  and configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges). Privileged
  accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator
  for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged
  accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access
  to privileged information or functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application
  of this requirement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain
  accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control system configurations
  for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate
  risk."
