Title: "3.4 Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment
  to the Internet"
Description: "All traffic outbound from the cardholder data environment should be
  evaluated to ensure that it follows established, authorized rules. Connections should
  be inspected to restrict traffic to only authorized communications (for example
  by restricting source/destination addresses/ports, and/or blocking of content).
  The set of controls will examine firewall and router configurations to verify that
  outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the Internet is explicitly
  authorized."
