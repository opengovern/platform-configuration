Title: "1.6 Use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing nonsecurity functions"
Description: "This requirement limits exposure when operating from within privileged
  accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations
  implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a
  change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations
  for the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided
  by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account."
