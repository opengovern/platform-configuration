Title: "Address common coding vulnerabilities in software-development processes like
  train developers at least annually in up-to-date secure coding techniques etc"
Description: "Common coding vulnerabilities in software-development processes as
  follows: train developers at least annually in up- to-date secure coding techniques,
  including how to avoid common coding vulnerabilities, develop applications based
  on secure coding guidelines. Note: The vulnerabilities listed at 6.5.1 through 6.5.10
  were current with industry best practices when this version of PCI DSS was published.
  However, as industry best practices for vulnerability management are updated (for
  example, the OWASP Guide, SANS CWE Top 25, CERT Secure Coding, etc.), the current
  best practices must be used for these requirements. The application layer is high-risk
  and may be targeted by both internal and external threats. Requirements 6.5.1 through
  6.5.10 are the minimum controls that should be in place, and organizations should
  incorporate the relevant secure coding practices as applicable to the particular
  technology in their environment. Application developers should be properly trained
  to identify and resolve issues related to these (and other) common coding vulnerabilities.
  Having staff knowledgeable of secure coding guidelines should minimize the number
  of security vulnerabilities introduced through poor coding practices. Training for
  developers may be provided in-house or by third parties and should be applicable
  for technology used. As industry-accepted secure coding practices change, organizational
  coding practices and developer training should likewise be updated to address new
  threatsâ€”for example, memory scraping attacks. The vulnerabilities identified in
  6.5.1 through 6.5.10 provide a minimum baseline. It is up to the organization to
  remain up to date with vulnerability trends and incorporate appropriate measures
  into their secure coding practices."
