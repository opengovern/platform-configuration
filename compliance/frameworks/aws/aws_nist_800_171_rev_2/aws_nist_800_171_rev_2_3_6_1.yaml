Title: "6.1 Establish an operational incident-handling capability for organizational
  systems that includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and
  user response activities"
Description: "Organizations recognize that incident handling capability is dependent
  on the capabilities of organizational systems and the mission/business processes
  being supported by those systems. Organizations consider incident handling as part
  of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and systems.
  Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including
  audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user and administrator
  reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability
  includes coordination among many organizational entities including mission/business
  owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical
  and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement
  offices, and the risk executive. As part of user response activities, incident response
  training is provided by organizations and is linked directly to the assigned roles
  and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate
  content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users
  may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the system;
  system administrators may require additional training on how to handle or remediate
  incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics,
  reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes
  user training in the identification/reporting of suspicious activities from external
  and internal sources. User response activities also includes incident response assistance
  which may consist of help desk support, assistance groups, and access to forensics
  services or consumer redress services, when required."
