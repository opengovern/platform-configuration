Title: "13.8 Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure
  of CUI during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards"
Description: "This requirement applies to internal and external networks and any
  system components that can transmit information including servers, notebook computers,
  desktop computers, mobile devices, printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines.
  Communication paths outside the physical protection of controlled boundaries are
  susceptible to both interception and modification. Organizations relying on commercial
  providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully
  dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual
  customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding
  the implementation of the controls for transmission confidentiality. In such situations,
  organizations determine what types of confidentiality services are available in
  commercial telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical
  to obtain the necessary safeguards and assurances of the effectiveness of the safeguards
  through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations implement compensating safeguards
  or explicitly accept the additional risk. An example of an alternative physical
  safeguard is a protected distribution system (PDS) where the distribution medium
  is protected against electronic or physical intercept, thereby ensuring the confidentiality
  of the information being transmitted."
