Title: "2.c For all other entities, if sensitive authentication data is received,
  review policies and procedures, and examine system configurations to verify the
  data is not retained after authorization"
Description: "Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation
  code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization
  is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows
  them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities
  that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often
  create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function.
  It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services
  to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need
  to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers,
  and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication
  data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason
  is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for
  the issuer and not one of convenience. Any such data must be stored securely and
  in accordance with all PCI DSS and specific payment brand requirements."
