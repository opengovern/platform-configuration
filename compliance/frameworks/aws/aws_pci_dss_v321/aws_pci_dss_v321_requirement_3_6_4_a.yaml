Title: "6.4.a Verify that key-management procedures include a defined cryptoperiod
  for each key type in use and define a process for key changes at the end of the
  defined cryptoperiod(s)"
Description: "A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a particular cryptographic
  key can be used for its defined purpose. Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod
  include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size
  or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the sensitivity of the data being
  encrypted. Periodic changing of encryption keys when the keys have reached the end
  of their cryptoperiod is imperative to minimize the risk of someoneâ€™s obtaining
  the encryption keys, and using them to decrypt data."
