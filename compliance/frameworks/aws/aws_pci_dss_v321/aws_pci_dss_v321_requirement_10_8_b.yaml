Title: "8.b Examine detection and alerting processes and interview personnel to verify
  that processes are implemented for all critical security controls"
Description: "The failure of a critical security control results in the generation
  of an alert.10.8.b Examine detection and alerting processes and interview personnel
  to verify that processes are implemented for all critical security controls, and
  that failure of a critical security control results in the generation of an alert.
  Note: This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service
  provider. Without formal processes to detect and alert when critical security controls
  fail, failures may go undetected for extended periods and provide attackers ample
  time to compromise systems and steal sensitive data from the cardholder data environment.
  The specific types of failures may vary depending on the function of the device
  and technology in use. Typical failures include a system ceasing to perform its
  security function or not functioning in its intended manner; for example, a firewall
  erasing all its rules or going offline."
