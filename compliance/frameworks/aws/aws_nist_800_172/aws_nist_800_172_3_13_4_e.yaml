Title: "13.4e Employ [Selection: (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined
  physical isolation techniques]; [Assignment: organization-defined logical isolation
  techniques]] in organizational systems and system components"
Description: "A mix of physical and logical isolation techniques (described below)
  implemented as part of the system architecture can limit the unauthorized flow of
  CUI, reduce the system attack surface, constrain the number of system components
  that must be secure, and impede the movement of an adversary. When implemented with
  a set of managed interfaces, physical and logical isolation techniques for organizational
  systems and components can isolate CUI into separate security domains where additional
  protections can be implemented. Any communications across the managed interfaces
  (i.e., across security domains), including for management or administrative purposes,
  constitutes remote access even if the communications remain within the organization.
  Separating system components with boundary protection mechanisms allows for the
  increased protection of individual components and more effective control of information
  flows between those components. This enhanced protection limits the potential harm
  from and susceptibility to hostile cyber-attacks and errors. The degree of isolation
  can vary depending on the boundary protection mechanisms selected. Boundary protection
  mechanisms include routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components
  into physically separate networks or subnetworks; virtualization and micro-virtualization
  techniques; encrypting information flows among system components using distinct
  encryption keys; cross-domain devices separating subnetworks; and complete physical
  separation (i.e., air gaps)."
