Title: "1.20 Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external systems"
Description: "External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations
  typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security
  requirements and controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented
  controls on those systems. External systems include personally owned systems, components,
  or devices and privately-owned computing and communications devices resident in
  commercial or public facilities. This requirement also addresses the use of external
  systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, including accessing
  cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software
  as a service) from organizational systems. Organizations establish terms and conditions
  for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies
  and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum, the types of applications
  that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems. If terms and
  conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be established, organizations
  may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.
  This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using
  external systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational
  systems. In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external systems
  contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm
  organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been effectively
  implemented can be achieved by third-party, independent assessments, attestations,
  or other means, depending on the assurance or confidence level required by organizations.
  Note that while “external” typically refers to outside of the organization's
  direct supervision and authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection
  of CUI across an organization, the organization may have systems that process CUI
  and others that do not. And among the systems that process CUI there are likely
  access restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore, from the perspective
  of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered 'external'
  to that system."
