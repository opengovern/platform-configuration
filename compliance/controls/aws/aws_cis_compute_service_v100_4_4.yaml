Title: "4.4 Ensure least privilege is used with Lambda function access"
Description: "Lambda is fully integrated with IAM, allowing you to control precisely what each Lambda function can do within the AWS Cloud. As you develop a Lambda function, you expand the scope of this policy to enable access to other resources. For example, for a function that processes objects put into an S3 bucket, it requires read access to objects stored in that bucket."
