Title: "11.2e Conduct cyber threat hunting activities [Selection (one or more): [Assignment:
  organizationdefined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-defined event]] to search
  for indicators of compromise in [Assignment: organization-defined systems] and detect,
  track, and disrupt threats that evade existing controls"
Description: "Threat hunting is an active means of defense that contrasts with traditional
  protection measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems,
  quarantining malicious code in sandboxes, and Security Information and Event Management
  (SIEM) technologies and systems. Cyber threat hunting involves proactively searching
  organizational systems, networks, and infrastructure for advanced threats. The objective
  is to track and disrupt cyber adversaries as early as possible in the attack sequence
  and to measurably improve the speed and accuracy of organizational responses. Indicators
  of compromise are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are identified on organizational
  systems at the host or network level and can include unusual network traffic, unusual
  file changes, and the presence of malicious code."
