Title: "2.1.c For a sample of system components, examine data transmissions to verify
  that passwords are unreadable during transmission"
Description: "Many network devices and applications transmit unencrypted, readable
  passwords across the network and/or store passwords without encryption. A malicious
  individual can easily intercept unencrypted passwords during transmission using
  a “sniffer,” or directly access unencrypted passwords in files where they are stored,
  and use this data to gain unauthorized access. Note: Testing Procedures 8.2.1.d
  and 8.2.1.e are additional procedures that only apply if the entity being assessed
  is a service provider."
