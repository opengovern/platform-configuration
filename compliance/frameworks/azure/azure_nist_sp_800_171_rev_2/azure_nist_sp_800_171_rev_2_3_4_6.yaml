Title: "4.6 Employ the principle of least functionality by configuring organizational
  systems to provide only essential capabilities"
Description: "Systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some
  of the functions and services routinely provided by default, may not be necessary
  to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. It is sometimes
  convenient to provide multiple services from single system components. However,
  doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.
  Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function
  per component. Organizations review functions and services provided by systems or
  components of systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates
  for elimination. Organizations disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical
  ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, transfer of information,
  and tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection
  and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based
  intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions,
  ports, protocols, and services."
