  modification, and deletion"

  log settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit system activity. Audit
  logging tools are those programs and devices used to conduct audit and logging activities.

  the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals.
  Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection and physical
  and environmental protection requirements."
