Title: "System Enviornment"
Description: "Include a detailed topology narrative and graphic that clearly depicts
  the system boundaries, system interconnections, and key devices. (Note: this does
  not require depicting every workstation or desktop, but include an instance for
  each operating system in use, an instance for portable components (if applicable),
  all virtual and physical servers (e.g., file, print, web, database, application),
  as well as any networked workstations (e.g., Unix, Windows, Mac, Linux), firewalls,
  routers, switches, copiers, printers, lab equipment, handhelds). If components of
  other systems that interconnect/interface with this system need to be shown on the
  diagram, denote the system boundaries by referencing the security plans or names
  and owners of the other system(s) in the diagram. [Insert a system topology graphic.
  Provide a narrative consistent with the graphic that clearly lists and describes
  each system component.]"
