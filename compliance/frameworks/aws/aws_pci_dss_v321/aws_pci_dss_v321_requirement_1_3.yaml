Title: "Examine firewall and router configurations—including but not limited to the
  choke router at the Internet, the DMZ router and firewall, the DMZ cardholder segment,
  the perimeter router, and the internal cardholder network segment—and perform the
  following to determine that there is no direct access between the Internet and system
  components in the internal cardholder network segment"
Description: "While there may be legitimate reasons for untrusted connections to
  be permitted to DMZ systems (e.g., to allow public access to a web server), such
  connections should never be granted to systems in the internal network. A firewall's
  intent is to manage and control all connections between public systems and internal
  systems, especially those that store, process or transmit cardholder data. If direct
  access is allowed between public systems and the CDE, the protections offered by
  the firewall are bypassed, and system components storing cardholder data may be
  exposed to compromise."
