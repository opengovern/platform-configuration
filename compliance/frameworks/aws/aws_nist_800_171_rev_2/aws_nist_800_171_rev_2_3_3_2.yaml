Title: "3.2 Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced
  to those users, so they can be held accountable for their actions"
Description: "This requirement ensures that the contents of the audit record include
  the information needed to link the audit event to the actions of an individual to
  the extent feasible. Organizations consider logging for traceability including results
  from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device
  connection, communications at system boundaries, configuration settings, physical
  access, nonlocal maintenance, use of maintenance tools, temperature and humidity,
  equipment delivery and removal, system component inventory, use of mobile code,
  and use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)."
