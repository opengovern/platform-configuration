Title: "1.7 Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and
  capture the execution of such functions in audit logs"
Description: "Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing
  system integrity checks, conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic
  key management activities. Nonprivileged users are individuals that do not possess
  appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms
  or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that
  require protection from non-privileged users. Note that this requirement represents
  a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in 3.1.2.
  Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized
  users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts,
  is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
  Logging the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in
  doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent
  threat."
